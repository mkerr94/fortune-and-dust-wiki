# Overview
The players meet Mags in the bar of the [[Clayborn Inn]] during the events of [[Session 2]]. They inadvertently inform her of the attack that resulted in the death of [[Whip]] and the injury of [[Thomias Blake]]. She gruffly instructs [[Hattie Clayborn]] to inform her if the players check out of the Clayborn Inn and warns the players to keep themselves in check while in [[Clement's Hollow]].

Mags preferred drink is a form of green absinthe, which before consuming she lights with bright blue flame from her mouth.

She wields a colossal, toothed greatsword. She is missing a few teeth and a finger on her left hand. She has bright green, reptilian eyes.As she breathes, wisps of smoke rise from her flaring nostrils.

On the back of her neck, she has a patch of skin where the scales have been removed and a tattoo now sits - a downward facing sword with an eye depicted in the centre of the hilt.
