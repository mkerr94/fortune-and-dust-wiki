# Overview

Twin human carpenter brothers of [[Clement's Hollow]].

Nearly indistinguishable, the two share the same thick mop of brown hair, bushy eyebrows and full beard. Arthur carries a hammer and a pocket full of nails, Neall a large wood saw.

The twins briefly converse with [[Gambit]] and [[Amotti]] during the events of [[Session 4]], after being tasked with emergency repairs to the western gate of Clement's Hollow by [[Holden Smith]] in the aftermath of the attack of the [[Mutant Lake-Lizards]].
