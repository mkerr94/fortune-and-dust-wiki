Large Lenity wildcat and companion to [[Holden Smith]].

Alvina comes up to above Holden's knees and is around 5 ft long. She has rough brown fur with black spots and startling green eyes.

She accompanies Holden on the night watches around the perimeter walls of [[Clement's Hollow]].

By Holden's account, he rescued Alvina as a kitten after her family and litter were killed by lake-lizards. Holden describes Alvina as big, even for a Lenity wildcat, and the two have a fierce bond. As a result, Holden warns the players that, while he is calm, Alvina is calm. If he's not... "well let's just say she can handle herself".
