# The Events of Session 4
The players face down the winged, insectoid Lenity lake-lizard with [[Holden Smith|Holden]] and [[Alvina]]. The creature begins to hover, swoop and snap at them from the air as they collectively try to bring it down. All the while, the leporine and three-headed lake lizards barge the western gate of [[Clement's Hollow]] as the thick wooden draw-bar bends and buckles under their combined strength.

[[Sel]] is badly wounded by the winged lake-lizard, being carried some 40 ft into the air and dropped from an aerial death-roll. As he rushes through the moonlit air to the ground below, the winged lake-lizard circles for the kill – before being slain by a crossbow bolt through the roof of the mouth fired by [[Elias Blackwood|Eli]]. The injured Sel rises from the ground just in time to see the two remaining lake-lizards finally crash through the gate, jaws dripping with a thick, black liquid. With a burst of purple, psionic energy, [[Lythara Sunstrider|Lythara]] slices the forearm of the leporine lake-lizard cleanly off with her glaive – the creature buckling and roaring in agony. A whistle from Holden and the scent of blood in her nostrils sends Alvina careening into the injured monster. The two roll under the rightmost watch platform of the gate and, after a brief flurry of movement, the Lenity wildcat emerges with the lake-lizard's throat in her jaws.

Enraged, the three-headed lake lizard begins to snap and thrash at the players. Hearing a noise from behind him, Eli watches as a grunting [[Magnolia 'Old Mags' Aurix|Old Mags]] joins the fray with her wicked, toothed great-sword. Despite the arrival of the old dragonborn, Sel is grabbed in the jaws of the lake-lizard and passes out with a sickening crunch of its jaws. Running behind the monster and ducking a swipe of its huge tail, [[public/Fortune & Dust/People & Organisations/Player Characters/Caeldrid Àrmann an Gealach|Caeldrid]] rises to slice it off with an upward slash of his sword, wreathed in bright green flame. As the incensed creature roars and its three heads begin to snap at each other, [[Wild Bill]] ascends the leftmost steps of the gate and drops the creature with a shot to the central head from one of his twin pistols.

Mutant terrors felled, the players look around to see townsfolk beginning to cautiously emerge from their homes for a look at the horror that has beset their walls – with Old Mag's ushering them back inside and instructing Holden to escort the players back to the [[Clayborn Inn]]. She indicates that she will call a town meeting for the next day to address the threat - "and I'll speak to Nate, too". After Eli explains his and [[Hattie Clayborn|Hattie]]'s parts in the night's events to the party, Holden arranges for the gate to be repaired by the Carpenter brothers Arthur and Neall, with whom [[Gambit]] and [[Amotti]] briefly exchange conversation.

Holden thanks the players for their help and escorts them back to the inn. Before returning, Sel asks Caeldrid to accompany him to [[Doc Lawrence's Surgery]], Eli decides to take a night-time stroll around the town, and Wild Bill stops outside to check in on Rusty Jack. The rest of the players make their way to the bar of the Clayborn Inn, where a tearful and still-hooded Hattie awaits them.
