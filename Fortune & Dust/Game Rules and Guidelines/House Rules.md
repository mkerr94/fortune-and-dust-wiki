# Gameplay Rules
The following rules will be includes on top of RAW (Rules as written).

## Dynamic Initiative
This means that, at the end of every combat round, we re-roll initiative (hopefully this keeps everyone on their toes and stops long fights from becoming repetitive) – Nat 20 initiative rolls will allow self-choice in initiative order – use counters to swap on the fly

## Secret Death Saves
Death save rolls will be done in secret and recovery/death revealed in role-play

## No Lingering Injuries
We will no longer play the lingering injuries ruleset

## Inspiration
Inspiration will be given for sexy role-playing and story engagement, and can be used to re-roll after the fact rather than having to be stated before rolling – if no point has been given in the session naturally there will be one inspiration point awarded on a group vote basis at the end – potentially boon cards

## No (Combat) Critical Failures
There will be no additional consequences to rolling a 1 in combat other than missing. However, rolling a 1 on a saving throw will result in a critical failure. 

## Potions Are Bonus Actions
Self explanatory

## Standard Flanking Rules
No longer using additional homebrew flanking rules, reverting back to RAW flanking.
