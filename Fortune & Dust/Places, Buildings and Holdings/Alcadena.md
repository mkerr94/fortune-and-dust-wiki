# Overview
Region or state of [[Novedeña]] in which the story of 'Fortune and Dust' takes place.

In New [[Novedeña|Novedeñan]] Common, the name 'Alcadena' means "the chained state".

The climate throughout the bulk of the Alcadena is characterised by dry, unforgiving heat (save for a few notable exceptions in areas near to or surrounding bodies of water such as [[Lake Lenity]], Lake Azura, the swamp of Aguavena and the Almario River). This dry climate and endemic soil infertility has led to food shortages in the state.

Alcadena is naturally fortified to the North and South by the Whispering Mountains and Almario River, respectively. Unexplored frontier-land lies to the West and the Sea of Swords to the East.

The state is governed by the [[Alcadenan Senate]], whose seat of power lies in the capital city of [[Samosetia]].

The colonial society in Alcadena is characterised by economic and social inequality. Some commonfolk, particularly in the two major cities, have achieved modest wealth by the founding of small businesses or the import/export of goods. However, most eke out a meagre living from the land in rural settlements or find menial work where they can in the cities.

In contrast, the wealthy upper class of Alcadena have found prosperity in mining the natural resources of the land and investing in the infrastructure of the burgeoning industrial revolution in the state. Those who have either come by wealth in this manner or have inherited it from familial wealth in Faerun are able to afford imported food from the homeland. This disparity has led to simmering civil unrest among the commonfolk.
