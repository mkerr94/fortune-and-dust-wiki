# Overview
Continent in which the story of 'Fortune and Dust' takes place.

A huge landmass to the West of Faerun across the Sea of Swords, settled by Faerunian immigrants around 200 years prior to the player character's arrival.

The region of the continent in which the story takes place is called [[Alcadena]], the only region of Novedeña yet mapped by Faerunian cartographers.
