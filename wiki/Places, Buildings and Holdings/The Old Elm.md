Sprawling, ancient elm tree that dominates the centre of a clearing in [[Lenity Woods]].

At its base, the trees roots and some of the larger low hanging branches form a network, twisting and grasping like the many-fold tentacles of some forest kraken. High above the platforms formed by the thick lower branches and the colossal, gnarled trunk, the upper canopy of the tree sprouts with bright new leaves - obscuring the sky beyond.  The iridescent Lenity lake-fog, thin and wispy in the rest of the woods seems to coalesce around the tree’s base. The tree is flanked to the north, south, east and west by four large stone tablets resembling giant gravestones. Each is in various stages of decay and ruin, yet still standing.

During the events of [[Session 3]], [[Elias Blackwood|Elias]] observes [[Hattie Clayborn]] sneaking out at night to the Old Elm and investigating the surrounding area before being ambushed by the [[Mutant Lake-Lizards]].
