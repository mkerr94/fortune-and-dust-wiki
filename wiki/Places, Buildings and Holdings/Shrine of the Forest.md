Sacred site found underneath the Old Elm in Lenity Woods outside of the town of Clement's Hollow.

The entrance was discovered by Wild Bill, Eli, Amotti and Lythara during Session 17 – revealed after placing their sea-glass beads into four standing stones around the Old Elm.

It is a circular chamber of earthen floor and walls directly beneath the roots of the great tree.

Home to a mysterious pool of glowing blue water in which the players found the missing Jebediah Clayborn.

The walls of the Shrine are engraved with symbols of animals found in and around Lake Lenity (a rabbit, a wild-cat and a lake-lizard). These engravings glow with the same electric green seen sparking through the fog of the lake.££
