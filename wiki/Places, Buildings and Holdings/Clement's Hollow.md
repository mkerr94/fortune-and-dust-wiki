# Overview
Town situated close to [[Lake Lenity]] and [[Lenity Woods]]. First destination of the players after departing [[Portumluna]], under instruction from [[Vanderbilt's Emissary]].

At the outset of the story, the Players travel to Clement's Hollow from [[Portumluna]] in the company of [[Thomias Blake]], in a carriage driven by [[Whip]]. They are heading for the town under the instruction of [[Vanderbilt's Emissary]] after learning that [[Marismente|Marismentan]] militia have recently been spotted nearby.

The players learn from Thomias Blake that Clement's Hollow is a small town of roughly 300 people ("minus the [[Marismente|Quagers]] o'course"). Thomias explains that the town has recently been the talk of [[The Western Star]] newspaper out of Portumluna due to strange disappearances and seemingly supernatural phenomena plaguing the townsfolk. Suspicious of this, Thomias notes that in his opinion the town faces a much more tangible threat from failing crop and agriculture – like the rest of Alcadena.

Clement’s Hollow is constructed inside a wall made of strong timber and iron. There is a central, wide street and several narrower ones branching off. There are at least two gates to this wall: one to the outskirts and road and one to [[Lake Lenity]]. The homes and businesses in the town are also constructed in wood and iron, in a somewhat irregular fashion. Many of the buildings have porch areas enclosed by post-fences. Above every other building in the town, the imposing frame of the [[The Barnett-Blake Ironworks|Barnett-Blake Ironworks]] towers with its multiple pipes, chimneys and gangways.

Home to: [[The Barnett-Blake Ironworks]], [[Doc Lawrence's Surgery]]; the [[Clayborn Inn]]; [[Tryst's General Store]].
