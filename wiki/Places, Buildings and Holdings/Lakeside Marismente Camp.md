Settlement on the shores of [[Lake Lenity]] occupied by a lakeside tribe of [[Marismente]].

Composed of several hexagonal tents of wooden-posting and woven bark/reeds, it has a central fire-pit serving as the main communal area.

The Marismente of the camp are a mixture of females, males and juveniles â€“ some warriors, some fishermen and some ironworkers. They are led by their matriarch, [[Rel-se]].
