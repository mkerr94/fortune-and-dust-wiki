# Overview

Arid region beyond the edge of [[Lenity Woods]].

The Players pass through here on their way to [[Fortuna Outpost]] during [[Session 27]].

The land beyond Lenity Woods is characterised by flowing, undulating dust clouds which cling to the ground. There is an unnatural dryness in the air, and one can feel the crunch of pieces of grit between their teeth when exploring here.

Otherwise flat and unyielding, the area is home to a network of canyons carved out in the plains which provide the territory of a group of creatures known as Dust-dwellers.
