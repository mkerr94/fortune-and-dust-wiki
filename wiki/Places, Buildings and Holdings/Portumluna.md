# Overview
Port city of [[Alcade√±a]] and gateway to the [[New World]]. Site of the arrival of the players three days prior to the outset of the story. The city is the hub through which all imported and exported goods pass and, as such, has been designed to maximise this process. Portumluna stands on seven colossal towers upon which the inhabitants live and work, inter-connected by grand bridges. The ground level of the city has been completely cleared to facilitate the transport of goods and immigrants from the Harbour of the Moon..
