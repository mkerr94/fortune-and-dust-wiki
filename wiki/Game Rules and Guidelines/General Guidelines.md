# Lore-Keeping
The DM wants the players to keep on top of the story and lore of Fortune and Dust from the earliest stage possible. OneNote wil be used as the **lore compendium**.

# Gameplay Style
I will be encouraging good engagement with the story, good character development and good roleplay

Good roleplay and strategising will be rewarded with boons/decreased DCs/NPC help etc

The campaign will hopefully have a good mix of mystery/detective work, environmental puzzles, dungeons, combat encounters and non-linear exploration BUT the focus will be on story, problem-solving and clever combat strategy (i.e. walk up hit thing will rarely yield the best results in combat)

The outset of the story and the initial driving motivation of the party will be roughly predefined and will be discussed individually in terms of character motivation/backstory if required, but as we settle into the story and world I want to encourage free exploration and adventure

As the campaign progresses, I'll also be open to discussing individual motivations (should there be any) and private character progression
