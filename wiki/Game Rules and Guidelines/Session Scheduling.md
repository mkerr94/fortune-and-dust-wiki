Unless very good reason otherwise (e.g. long-notice plans, work commitments, holidays etc), Tue evening will be kept clear for DnD

When only one member of the party can't make a given session, they can be asked to skip the session and allow the DM to play passively as their character (leaving any specific action requests) and fill them in afterward

Whenever Raj comes up from London, we try and schedule an in-person weekend session to let him play in person

Assign someone whose job it is to establish session availability at the start of every month, or I will do it as DM
