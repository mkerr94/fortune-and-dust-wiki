# Description
Elias Blackwood is a lean, wiry man in his early thirties, standing at around 5'11". His dark, tousled hair falls a few inches above his shoulders, often kept tucked behind his ears. His piercing green eyes, sharp and observant, seem to miss nothing, constantly darting about to take in his surroundings. Elias's face is marked by a few faint scars, souvenirs of past encounters and close calls, adding a rugged edge to his otherwise handsome features. 

Elias is rarely seen without his worn, dark brown Stetson-style hat, which casts a shadow over his eyes. His attire is practical and unassuming, favouring dark, muted colours that help him blend into the shadows. A well-worn, hooded cloak often shrouds his form, concealing an array of hidden pockets and compartments filled with the tools of his trade. 

Elias often smokes a pipe, the smoke curling around him as he contemplates his next move. Despite his stealthy appearance, there is a quiet intensity in his gaze.
