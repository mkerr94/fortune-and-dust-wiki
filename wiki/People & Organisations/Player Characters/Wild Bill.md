# Description

![[wild-bill-pfp.png|400]]

Wild Bill is 29 years old. He has long swept back black hair and rough stubble, with a few scars and scratches decorating his face. His eyes shine a deep emerald green. 

He dresses in a shirt and black tie, with a dark brown leather waistcoat and matching trousers. He wears traditional cowboy boots with copper spurs. He also wears a shabby and rough light brown suede leather overcoat. His traditional brown leather Stetson hat confirms him as a cowpoke, farm worker and outlaw. He wears a red and black plaid cape, and has a red and black paisley patterned bandana around his neck. 

He carries two iron and copper revolvers, one named Luck and one named Lucy. Everytime he kills a significant foe, he notches a score in the barrel of the gun.

He has a black horse with orange patches on it called Rusty Jack, whom is around 12 years old. Rusty Jack has always been a faithful companion to Bill, and he trusts his horse more than he trusts anyone else in the world.

During a showdown with some hellscape furnace spiders in the Barnett Blake Ironworks, Wild Bill felled the creatures while he himself was engulfed in flames, proclaiming himself 'Wild Bill, The Flaming Gun'.
