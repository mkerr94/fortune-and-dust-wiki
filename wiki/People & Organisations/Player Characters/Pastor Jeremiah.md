# Description

Pastor Jeremiah is a rotund, rosy cheeked, side burn wearing, gun slinging, god fearing classic western pastor. He is armed with a bible, and sworn to seek vengeance against those who have hurt the weak or needy of Alcadeña. Jeremiah engages in battle using a thick tome he calls “The Good Book”, and is a devout follower of a deity he calls “The Creator”.

Jeremiah’s faith is described as old, unknowable, and coloured with melancholy - as of a former magnificence now fading. His beliefs manifest as a deep respect for all living and growing things, and a reverence for the continual cycle of renewal and rebirth.

The Players meet Jeremiah in [[The Dustlands]] beyond the edge of [[Lenity Woods]], during [[Session 26]]. Jeremiah, a travelling wagon driver, is looking for his friend, Brez-ak, whom he believes to have been kidnapped by local creatures known as [[The Dust-dwellers]].

Jeremiah travels on a wagon drawn by his horse, Charon. The Players find that the wagon is filled with various sizes of glass jar. Each one contains one or more glowing green fireflies.
