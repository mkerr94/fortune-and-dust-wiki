# Overview
During the events of [[Session 2]], the players learn that she and Jeb have recently gone missing.

During the events of [[Session 5]], [[Hattie Clayborn]] tells the players that her mother disappeared before [[Jedediah ‘Jeb’ Clayborn|Jeb]], and that her father, [[Sam Clayborn|Sam]], suspects that they have both left [[Clement's Hollow]] and the [[Clayborn Inn]] for a new life in [[Portumluna]].

In Marie's letter to Sam (see [[Marie Clayborn's Letter]]), that [[Elias Blackwood|Elias]] discovers in the office of the Clayborn Inn during [[Session 6]], it's revealed that Marie has passed from an unknown illness sometime prior to the player's arrival. In the letter, which the text implies was intended for Sam to read after her passing, she seems at peace with the end of her life and asks her husband not to mourn her but to stay strong for their children.
