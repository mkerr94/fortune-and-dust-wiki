Old dwarven woman and resident of [[Clement's Hollow]].

Seen by the players on her porch in the middle of the night during the events of [[Session 2]], while being directed to [[Jessie 'Doc' Lawrence]]'s surgery by [[Holden Smith]].


Holden to Issy in [[Session 1]]: 

> *"Why don't you get on back inside Issy".*

During the events of [[Session 5]], [[Caeldrid Àrmann an Gealach|Caeldrid]] and [[Sel]] observe Issy sleeping on her porch on their way to Doc Lawrence's. They later learn from Jessie that Issy was living in this area with her husband before Clement's Hollow was established, and is the best person to ask about town history.

>"Though, her mind ain't what it used to be..."


In [[Session 6]], while having tea with Issy, [[Gambit]] and [[Amotti]] learn that she and her late husband used to own a small fishing shack on [[Lake Lenity]] – now owned by [[Ignatius 'Nate' Barnett]].
