# Overview
The players meet Hattie and hire rooms at the [[Clayborn Inn]] from her during the events of [[Session 2]]. They briefly gossip with her about the goings on in town, and she reveals that "Old Clarence has a strange lodger, mage-born! But now you've got me gossiping!".

During the events of [[Session 3]], [[Elias Blackwood|Elias]] follows a cloaked Hattie to the clearing in [[Lenity Woods]] where [[The Old Elm]] stands. He observes her investigating the base of the tree before being ambushed by the mutant Lake Lizards - "We gotta run, honey!".

The players later learn in [[Session 5]] that Hattie was out by the Old Elm searching for her brother, [[Jedediah ‘Jeb’ Clayborn|Jeb]]. They also learn that Hattie's relationship with her father Sam is strained by the fact that she believes her mother and brother to be in danger, while he insists that they have simply left [[Clement's Hollow]] for [[Portumluna]].
