# Overview
Citizen of Clement's Hollow.

A cow belonging to him ("one of Slim Ed's girls") is found mutilated, presumably by the [[Mutant Hounds]], on the outskirts of [[Clement's Hollow]] during the events of [[Session 1]].

The players learn from [[Hattie Clayborn]] during [[Session 5]] that Ed employed [[Jedediah ‘Jeb’ Clayborn|Jeb]] as a ranch hand. Other than [[Sam Clayborn|Sam]] and Hattie herself, Ed was the last one to see Jeb on the day he disappeared.
