# Overview

Citizen of [[Clement's Hollow]].

A cow belonging to him ("one of Slim Ed's girls") is found mutilated, presumably by the [[Mutant Hounds]], on the outskirts of [[Clement's Hollow]] during the events of [[Session 1]].

The players learn from [[Hattie Clayborn]] during [[Session 5]] that Ed employed [[Jedediah ‘Jeb’ Clayborn|Jeb]] as a ranch hand. Other than [[Sam Clayborn|Sam]] and Hattie herself, Ed was the last one to see Jeb on the day he disappeared.

>"He's a stubborn one, is Ed - and proud too!"

The players finally meet Slim Ed during the events of [[Session 21]]. He visits the [[Clayborn Inn]] during the player’s dinner with Hattie, Sam and Jeb.

The players discover that he is in fact a **nergaliid** - a huge toad-like creature.

> “Suddenly, you hear a rumbling noise from the front door of the Inn. The structure seems to shake as the sound of footsteps approach. From the bar door, stooping to enter, you see a creature emerge unlike any other you've yet encountered. It walks on two stout legs, its arms so long that they reach the floor, hands curved backward to stop from dragging. By rights it seems like this being should be walking on all fours. From head to toe, the monstrous figure is covered in hard seaweed-green scales. It doesn't appear to have a discernible neck, only a relatively square head occupied by two small eyes of crystal blue under ridged-brows and a wide mouth through which you can see two rows of short, razor-sharp teeth. All in all, the creature appears to be around 10 ft tall and of such bulk that its limbs and body appear to bulge. Bizarrely, it wears a Stetson hat, round glasses resting on a stumpy ridged nose, a waistcoat and a bolo tie.”

Ed’s full name is revealed to be Edward Kyler. The players find him to be proud, polite and very fond of Jebediah Clayborn and the cattle on his ranch. During their first meeting, he describes the release of two of his ‘girls’ by an unknown intruder - who left behind a sea glass bead necklace identical to the one given to the players by [[Rel-se]] and the Lakeside [[Marismente]].
