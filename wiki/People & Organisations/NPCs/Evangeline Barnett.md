# Overview

The players learn from [[Holden Smith]] during the events of Session 2 that Evangeline has recently fallen ill.

While talking to [[Jessie 'Doc' Lawrence|Jessie Lawrence]] in [[Session 5]], [[Sel]] and [[Caeldrid Àrmann an Gealach|Caeldrid]] learn that, when Evangeline fell sick, they first brought her to [[Jessie 'Doc' Lawrence|Jessie Lawrence]] for diagnosis and care. Having done all she could to stem the strange illness that had taken hold of Evangeline, [[Ignatius 'Nate' Barnett|Nate]] later took his wife back to the Ironworks – she has not been seen in town since.

Later, during a strange telepathic connection with [[Thomias Blake]], Sel sees a vision of Evangeline from the past in which she appears as a dark-skinned, beautiful woman with a warm smile and raven hair. She wears a dress of soft white linen.

Sel learns more regarding the nature of Evangeline's illness from [[Ignatius 'Nate' Barnett|Ignatius]] while being held captive by him during the events of [[Session 12]]. According to Ignatius, in her current condition, she could easily destroy the entire town of [[Clement's Hollow]].

In [[Session 14]], Sel shares a strange telepathic connection with Evangeline and is able to briefly see through her eyes and control her actions. During this event, Sel realises that Evangeline is pregnant and in great pain. Her body and mind are contorted by her mysterious illness – although her spirit appears to remain defiant. Sel sees that Evangeline is tormented by strange, formless figure of black energy. Through her, Sel is able to fend off the will of this entity for a short while before the connection is lost.

The Players finally meet Evangeline in the flesh at the end of [[Session 24]], where they find her having overcome her sickness and reunite her with her beloved husband, Ignatius
