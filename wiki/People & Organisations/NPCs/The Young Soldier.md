# Overview

Young, human male whom the Players conclude to be from [[Fortuna Outpost]].

He collapses on the threshold of the Town Hall of [[Clement's Hollow]] during the events of [[Session 25]], muttering the phrase "*She sees us...".*

Upon examination of the body in [[Session 26]], [[Caeldrid Ã€rmann an Gealach|Caeldrid]] and [[Sel]] discover the following details:

- Young human male (early 20's), light beard and rough brown hair
- Clad in soldier's leathers: leather torso armour, leather skirt in strips, leather greaves all trimmed with gold paint
- Protectorate symbol of The Watchful Sword painted in gold at centre of chest (same symbol tattooed at base of neck)
- Blood stains on his face from a dry wound on his forehead underneath his hairline (blunt trauma from the butt of a rifle) - likely cause of death
- Blood soaking his hands
- Holds [[Magnolia 'Old Mags' Aurix|Old Mags]]' letter in his hands
- Charcoal stick in pocket, the number '6' in tally marks written on inner right forearm in charcoal

The soldier shocks the group when he suddenly wakes and utters the following incoherent speech before mysteriously disappearing altogether:

> *"Six times. I am the watchful sword of the Warrior, my brothers are my hilt. Six times. None shall trespass against us or those our swords protect. Six times. There is no protection from her, there's no relief. Six times. She sees us all, inside and out. Insides, out. Six times. A watcher in the dark. Six times. Warrior forgive them, forgive me..."*
