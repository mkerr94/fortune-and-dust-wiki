# Overview

During the events of Session 2, the players are introduced to Jessie by [[Holden Smith]]. They deliver the body of [[Whip]] for post-humous examination and hand over the severely injured [[Thomias Blake]] for treatment.

From items found around her home and surgery, the players infer that Jessie has a keen interest in herbal medicine and the anatomy and physiology of the various races of [[Alcadeña]].

While talking with her during [[Session 5]], [[Sel]] and [[Caeldrid Àrmann an Gealach|Caeldrid]] learn that this interest extends particularly to the local medicinal flora of [[Lake Lenity]] and the nearby woods, as well as the physiology of the [[Marismente]].

In [[Session 17]], the players take Jessie to see the sealed bedroom of [[Ignatius 'Nate' Barnett|Ignatius]] and [[Evangeline Barnett|Evangeline]] Barnett – and show her [[The Black Fluid]] which has enveloped the door. Jessie displays a keen interest in the biology of the fluid and theorises that it is all part of a single organism. She reveals that, when Evangeline Barnett fell sick, she was brought to Jessie's surgery first – and that the initial stages of her illness were near identical to the current symptoms being displayed by Sel

In [[Session 22]], after learning from [[Rel-se]] that the bead left by whoever broke into [[Slim Ed]]'s ranch belonged to Jessie, the Players discover that she has been behind many of the terrible events in [[Clement's Hollow]]. When Evangeline fell sick, they brought her to Jessie first. Terrified by the sickness that had taken hold of Evangeline, Jessie took a sample and began to work on creating a vaccine by combining the black fluid with extracts from the [[Lenitium Florana]] flower. Unsuccessfully attempting to administer it to local wildlife, Jessie inadvertently created the [[Mutant Hounds]] and the [[Mutant Lake-Lizards]]. She then released some of Slim Ed's cattle hoping that the creatures would satiate themselves on this easy prey rather than attacking the townsfolk or the [[Marismente]]. She also tested her solution on Thomias Blake, leading to his infection.

While the Players are at the Marismente camp during Session 22, Holden Smith learns from Issy that she has observed Jessie sneaking out in the middle of the night. He confronts Jessie, but she poisons Holden and Alvina with poisoned tea and milk. The players find her having administered herself with the failed vaccine, which transforms her into a terrifying mutated exaggeration of her Firbolg self.

# Description

![[jessie-doc-lawrence.png| 300]]

Jessie is a female firbolg, around 30 years old. She has round, bright eyes (one pale yellow, one pale green) with an intelligent spark and a stern look. At first glance, she is strikingly beautiful. Her skin is pale but cheeks slightly reddened. Her hair is tied in a thick plait and splits at the parting between stark white and a deep reddish brown - (Like her eyes, this is due to heterochromia at birth).

From beneath her hair, protrude two elongated ears, that point slightly upward when she raises her eyebrows. Her nose is slightly flattened and rounded, as with all firbolgs. She wears a brown sleeveless tunic and a white undershirt underneath with her sleeves rolled up. She also wears a short necklace with a charm on it.

At rest, she stands hands on hips and often stares of into the distance, lost in some thought or consideration which she considers beyond anyone else in the room.
