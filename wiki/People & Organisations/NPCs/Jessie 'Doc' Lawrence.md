# Overview
During the events of Session 2, the players are introduced to Jessie by [[Holden Smith]]. They deliver the body of [[Whip]] for post-humous examination and hand over the severely injured [[Thomias Blake]] for treatment.

From items found around her home and surgery, the players infer that Jessie has a keen interest in herbal medicine and the anatomy and physiology of the various races of [[Alcadena]].

# Description
![[jessie-doc-lawrence.png| 300]]
Jessie is a female firbolg, around 30 years old. She has round, bright eyes (one pale yellow, one pale green) with an intelligent spark and a stern look. At first glance, she is strikingly beautiful. Her skin is pale but cheeks slightly reddened. Her hair is tied in a thick plait and splits at the parting between stark white and a deep reddish brown - (Like her eyes, this is due to heterochromia at birth).

From beneath her hair, protrude two elongated ears, that point slightly upward when she raises her eyebrows. Her nose is slightly flattened and rounded, as with all firbolgs. She wears a brown sleeveless tunic and a white undershirt underneath with her sleeves rolled up. She also wears a short necklace with a charm on it.

At rest, she stands hands on hips and often stares of into the distance, lost in some thought or consideration which she considers beyond anyone else in the room.
