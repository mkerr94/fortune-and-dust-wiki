# Overview

Mysterious figure who has taken up residence in [[Clement's Hollow]].

Observed by [[Elias Blackwood|Elias]] during [[Session 6]] to be using the rooftops of Clement's Hollow to remain unseen. He attends the Town Meeting called in the aftermath of the lake-lizard attack, but remains at the back. Despite this, he shares a brief introduction with [[Gambit]].

While being held captive by Ignatius during the events of [[Session 12]], [[Sel]] learns that Red has previously tried to trespass in the [[The Barnett-Blake Ironworks|Barnett-Blake Ironworks]] too – and has been stopped by [[Ignatius 'Nate' Barnett|Nate]].

During their conversations with Red in [[Session 15]], the players learn more about him. They learn that he too came to [[Alcadeña]] by sea, and that he is working for an unknown employer. Red reveals that he was drawn to [[Clement's Hollow]] by rumours of the curse, seeking an unknown artefact which he no longer believes to be in town.


# Description

Red wears knee-high leather riding boots, black leather trousers, a tied white jerkin and a black half-cape made of cloth over one shoulder. He wears small full-moon sunglasses and a black Stetson – under which rolls of neck-length auburn curls can be seen. At his hips, in leather holsters, sit one copper and one silver revolver.
