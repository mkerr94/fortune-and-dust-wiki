# Overview
First mentioned by [[Holden Smith]] during the events of [[Session 2]].

In a vision of the past had by [[Sel]] during [[Session 5]], Ignatius is revealed to be a tall, thin man with ashen-grey skin and slicked-black hair. He wears a waistcoat, shirt with sleeves rolled up and top few buttons undone, and pinstripe trousers.

In [[Session 6]], it is revealed that Nate's wife, [[Evangeline Barnett]], is very ill and recovering in their quarters at the Ironworks. In addition to these quarters, the players learn that Ignatius owns a shack on an island in [[Lake Lenity]], purchased from [[Issy]] shortly after his, [[Thomias Blake|Thomias]]' and Evangeline's arrival in the town.

In [[Session 10]], while investigating the small fishing shack owned by Nate in the middle of Lake Lenity, the players discover an experimental journal belonging to him. The entries therein seem to detail his work on refining a particular technique of pyromancy, which he calls *'pyromancy corporis'*, which is able to manipulate the reactive oxygen species in the tissue of living things.

In [[Session 12]], while being held captive by Ignatius, Sel learns that he has been working on refining his pyromantic skills in order to use them to save his wife, [[Evangeline Barnett|Evangeline]], from her mysterious illness.
