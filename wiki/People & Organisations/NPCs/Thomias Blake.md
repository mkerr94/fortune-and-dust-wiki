# Overview

Ageing male halfling and travelling companion to the Players at the outset of the story.

Co-founder and representative of [[The Barnett-Blake Ironworks]].

Thomias is around 4 ft tall and around 100 years old, and wears a fairly tattered grey duster made to his size. His hair is unkempt and scruffy, and his eyes have a wild spark in them that gives them the impression of youth beyond the rest of his body. He has a rough stubble. The tips of his fingers are blackened with what looks like soot, visible through his fingerless, woollen gloves. He wears a brown jumper with scorched holes leading through to his undershirt, rough brown trousers made of tan and a pair of steel-capped boots. He has a charm which sits on a chain, tucked into his jumper. He speaks with a quiet, Southern-lilted voice that conveys wit, kindness and wisdom and a healthy dollop of Southern showmanship and charm.

Thomias travels regularly to and from Portumluna to meet with representatives of the [[Vanderbilt Railway Company]], who are in business with the Ironworks.

While travelling with Thomias in the carriage, the Players learn that Thomias is fiercely proud of his town and the role he plays in it. He speaks fondly of the people of Clement's Hollow and laments that they have fallen on such hard times.

During his time with the Players in Session One, Thomias reveals pyromantic magical powers. He is injured when the Players are attacked by the [[Mutant Hounds]].

In [[Session 5]], [[Sel]] experiences a strange telepathic connection with Thomias after attempting to contact him with Message while the halfling was still recovering and unconscious in [[Doc Lawrence's Surgery]]. In a vision, Sel sees through Thomias eyes a moment lost in time, during which [[Issy]], Thomias and [[Ignatius 'Nate' Barnett|Nate]] and [[Evangeline Barnett]] share a cup of tea on Issy's porch while construction takes place around them.
