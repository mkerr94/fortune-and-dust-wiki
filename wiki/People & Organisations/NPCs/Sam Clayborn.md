# Overview
Mentioned during the events of Session 2 to the players by Holden Smith as the father to [[Jebediah ‘Jeb’ Clayborn|Jeb]] and [[Hattie Clayborn]] and husband to [[Marie Clayborn]].

The players meet Sam during [[Session 5]], while talking with Hattie and [[Holden Smith|Holden]] in the [[Clayborn Inn]], after their encounter with the [[Mutant Lake-Lizards]].

During the events of Session 6, Elias discovers a letter in Sam's office at the Clayborn Inn. In the letter, his wife Marie bids him farewell and asks him not to mourn her passing but to stay strong for Jeb and Hattie. Sam has clearly been hiding this letter from Hattie and lying when insisting that Marie has simply left the family to travel to Portumluna.
