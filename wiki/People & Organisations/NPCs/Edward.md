# Overview

Younger brother of [[Gambit]] seen in a dream during [[Session 18]].

Edward is a young gnome of excitable and eager nature. He has a rough mop of black hair and bright blue eyes. During the dream, he and Gambit steal a dodecahedral object from the library of a grand manor house and try to make their escape before Edward is hit by a seemingly fatal spell during their flight.
