The military force and police of [[Alcadena]]. They enforce the law as set by the [[Alcadenan Senate]]. Referred to in the [[Vanderbilt Contract]] as ' The Protectorate of the Alcadenan Senate'.

The Players learn from [[Thomias Blake]] that, among the commonfolk, the Protectorate are known as the 'Tecs'. They also learn that, in [[Clement's Hollow]], there is no great Protectorate presence and no particular love of the organisation among the rural folk of the frontier.
