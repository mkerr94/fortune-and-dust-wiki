The military force and police of [[Alcadeña]]. They enforce the law as set by the [[Alcadenan Senate]]. Referred to in the [[Vanderbilt Contract]] as ' The Protectorate of the Alcadenan Senate'.

The Players learn from [[Thomias Blake]] that, among the commonfolk, the Protectorate are known as the 'Tecs'. They also learn that, in [[Clement's Hollow]], there is no great Protectorate presence and no particular love of the organisation among the rural folk of the frontier.

In [[Session 6]], the players learn from [[Magnolia 'Old Mags' Aurix|Old Mags]] that members of the Protectorate are marked by a symbol tattooed on the base of their necks – a downward-facing sword with a lidless eye set in its crossguard.
