Ironworks co-founded by [[Thomias Blake]], [[Ignatius 'Nate' Barnett]] and [[Evangeline Barnett]].

Currently in business with the [[Vanderbilt Railway Company]].

In [[Session 6]], the players gain more familiarity with the layout of the structure. A large, central work-floor where most of the material is processed is flanked by smaller rooms across two floors accessible by gangplank. There is a storage cellar on the basement level, as well as a secondary structure to the rear of the main building accessible through either a staircase leading up from the ground outside or through [[Ignatius 'Nate' Barnett|Ignatius Barnett]]'s office off of the main work-floor.

"The huge building towers over you. Up close, you can see that it is formed of a large central portion, and three smaller buildings – two on one side, one larger on the other. The side buildings are connected to the main by what seems to be conveyor belts. From the central building, various pipes and chimneys protrude, giving the whole structure and irregular and thorny appearance.

The conveyors and external piping of the huge iron building, previously at rest, now clank, hum and whistle with activity. The puffs of grey-black smoke rising from the various chimneys give the whole construction the look of a giant piece of unrefined ore, still smouldering from the fires of the earth. The large main door, previously closed and bolted, now lies ajar with a red, molten glow coming from the interior

Inside, the noise and whir of machinery is near-deafening. The air is filled with a miasma of oppressive heat, and the air shimmers in front of you as you look around.

The main chamber has a cavernous ceiling, with conveyor belts and aqueducts transfer molten metal, water and rough slag to and from the various gangways and adjoining rooms. This gives the upper floors the impression of a hundred threads tied to a map, criss-crossing this way and that.

On the gangways at either side of the hall and in the centre of the room, sweat-drenched workers man their stations and move to and fro carrying baskets of material from one place to the next. Some wear metal and glass visors, and pull levers allowing red-hot molten liquid to spill from cauldrons on chains and pass from one aqueduct to the next and further down the pipeline.  While most are recognisably of the Faerunian races, some of the skulking, lithe [[Marismente]] move among them – operating heavy levers and pulleys and gracefully moving water from one pipeline to another with gentle waves of their lightly-webbed hands.

The air fills periodically with steam and smoke as bars of molten red iron, glowing like embers, pass on conveyor belts and are quenched with a deluge of water pulled by the Marismente from troughs at their feet before moving into adjoining rooms.

You can see that, on the left hand wall there are two door-ways (one to your immediate front-left, one further toward the back of the room. On the right hand wall, two similar doorways occupy the bottom floor, with matching ones sitting above on the gang-planked upper floor. On the upper floor, at the back of the main hall, a set of ornate double doors sits in the centre of the back wall."
