# Overview
Indigenous people of [[Alcadena]].

Their historic home lies in the vast swamp-city of Aguavena, however many now live and work in the settlements of the Faerunian colonists. In the early days of Faerunian settlement in Alcadena, the Marismente provided material assistance and knowledge to the colonists and were linked by prosperous trade â€“ a situation which has deteriorated in the modern era.

While most contemporary Marismente live in a fragile peace with the colonists, some rogue groups have formed militia and use guerrilla tactics to attack key elements of the industrial progress of the colonists. At the outset of the story of 'Fortune and Dust', the players are investigating a recent sighting of one such group near the town of [[Clement's Hollow]]. They have previously learned from [[Vanderbilt's Emissary]] aboard the Flor de Mayo that Eva Vanderbilt was kidnapped by Marismentan militia, meaning the group sighted near Clement's Hollow may have knowledge of her whereabouts.

While travelling to Clement's Hollow, the Players learn more from [[Thomias Blake]]. Thomias explains that, a few days prior to the Player's arrival, soldiers from [[The Protectorate]] warned the management of [[The Barnett-Blake Ironworks]] that Marismentan militia had been spotted nearby and may attempt a raid on the foundry. Thomias also mentions that the Ironworks employs some Marismente and speaks of them respectfully, noting that they keep themselves to themselves and don't cause any trouble.

The players also gather from Thomias that, among the Faerunian colonists, the Marismente are often referred to as 'Quagers'.
