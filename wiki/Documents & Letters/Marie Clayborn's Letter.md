>A letter written by [[Marie Clayborn]] addressed to her husband [[Sam Clayborn|Sam]] before her passing. 

To my dearest Sam,

If you've done as you were told, for once, then I'll be gone by the time you read this. I don't want you to linger on my passing, all things must go, in the end. You and Jessie did everything you could, and I'll be forever grateful for it.

I know you'll want to lose yourself in your chores and your fussing, but I need you to be strong for me. I need you to be strong for Jeb and Hattie. When you tell them what's happened, you'll need to be brave – but you can do it.

Those kids will outlast you Sam, as they've outlasted me. Soon, Clement's Hollow just won't be big enough for them, and you'll have to let them go.

Tell Jeb to go and see the railway, and that I'm sorry I never got to take him. And Hattie, you tell our girl that this new land is waiting for her – she just has to go out there and take it.

I've been thinking about when we first came to town. You fresh off your daddy's farm, me lost in my dreams. Being with you, building our little place, and raising Jeb and Hattie made all of them come true.

Don't be blue for me, my love. If you ever need me, just look out on the lake when the moon shines brightest. When you feel the lake-fog press close against your cheek, I'll be with you.

All my love, now and always

Marie
