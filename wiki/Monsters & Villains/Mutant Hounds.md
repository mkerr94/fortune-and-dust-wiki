# Overview
Pack of three mutated creatures resembling large dogs that attack the Players, [[Thomias Blake]], and [[Whip]] during the events of [[Session 1]].

Displaying differing phenotypes of an unexplained mutation, the hounds attack the Players through unique predatory tools: enlarged muscular strength and fangs; a poison stinger; and gripping tentacles.

When injured, flesh from the hounds appears to writhe and fizzle with unknown energy.

Defeated by the Players during the events of Session One, but not before killing Whip and gravely injuring Thomias Blake.
