# Overview

Predatory humanoid race inhabiting the canyon area of [[The Dustlands]]. Encountered by the Players during [[Session 27]].

They are capable of basic imitation of sound, using this skill to lure unsuspecting prey into the canyons. Although sensitive to sunlight and rarely found hunting outside of their canyon home, they have recently been expanding to greater and greater territory.

The dust-dwellers fought by the Players during Session 27 and [[Session 28]] were actually under the control of [[Brez-ak]], the corrupted [[Marismente|Marismentan]] shaman and former friend of [[Pastor Jeremiah]]. Brez-ak claimed to have been given control of them by a mysterious patron. After his defeat, the dust-dwellers turned on him and devoured him.

# Description

The Dust-dwellers are between 5-6 ft tall. They have sinewy limbs with sharp, elongated fingers and toes. Their skin is leathery grey-green in its natural state, but they are capable of rudimentary camouflage. Their ovoid heads are dominated by a circular mouth with rows of sharp teeth. They possess two large, round, brown eyes which are hidden beneath imperceptible lids when not open.
