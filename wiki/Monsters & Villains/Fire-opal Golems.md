# Overview

Malformed homunculi created from the Fire-Opals by some magical means by [[Ignatius Barnett, Flame Vessel]] during [[Session 15]]. The golems terrible eyes stare blankly and endlessly, and they emit a chilling glassy scream from their stretched and distorted mouths.

After the calming of Ignatius Barnett, Flame Vessel in [[Session 16]], the golems lose their form and collapse â€“ returning to their fire opal form, now extinguished and dull.
