# Overview
Three mutated Lenity lake-lizards which ambush [[Hattie Clayborn]] and [[Elias Blackwood|Elias]] during the events of [[Session 3]].

Initially ambushing Hattie at the base of [[The Old Elm]], the lake-lizards chase her, Elias, [[Amotti]] and [[Gambit]] to the western gate of [[Clement's Hollow]] â€“ where they are met by the rest of the players, as well as [[Holden Smith]] and [[Alvina]].

The mutated lake-lizards are defeated by the players during the events of [[Session 4]], after which their attack causes [[Magnolia 'Old Mags' Aurix|Old Mags]] to call a town meeting for the following day and arrange for repairs to the western gate of Clement's Hollow.

# Description
Like the mutant hounds, the lake-lizards display varying phenotypes caused by an unknown mutation: one is equipped with dragonfly-like wings; one has enlarged hind legs and elongated ears; and one has three independent heads. Each appears to drip a thick, black liquid from their jaws.
