# Overview

Huge, seemingly mechanical spider encountered in the Furnace Room of the [[The Barnett-Blake Ironworks|Barnett-Blake Ironworks]] by [[Wild Bill]], [[Elias Blackwood|Eli]], [[Amotti]] and [[Gambit]].

It has razor-sharp, serrated forelimbs and terrible, endlessly clicking mandibles. Its body is wreathed in shadow and flame. 

The players are able to defeat the Furnace Spider by cooling its molten body with barrels of coolant fluid – with Wild Bill striking the final blow with a bullet fired through a coolant barrel. Upon death, the Furnace Spider contorts and compacts to leave behind a Fire Opal and one of its forelimbs – which appears to have something hot encased inside.
