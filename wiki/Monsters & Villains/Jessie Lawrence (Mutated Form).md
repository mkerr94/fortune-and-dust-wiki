# Overview

Twisted form of the town doctor of [[Clement's Hollow]], [[Jessie 'Doc' Lawrence|Jessie Lawrence]]e. Although well-intentioned, Jessie was the true agent behind the spread of the Curse of Clement’s Hollow. Eventually, she attempts to use her failed vaccine against the black sickness on herself. It mutates her into a grotesque mockery of her Firbolg form and she attacks the Players in the streets of the town. She is eventually felled after being caught in [[Amotti]]’s Moonbeam, at which point she succumbs and reverts to her natural self upon death.
