# Overview

Mysterious black fluid encountered by the players throughout their adventures in [[Clement's Hollow]].

The fluid is found in the blood and saliva of several mutated creatures in the woods and plains around the town, such as the [[Mutant Hounds]], [[Mutant Lake-Lizards]], and the [[Lord of the Lake]].

Inside the belly of the Lord of the Lake, [[Sel]] encounters a concentration of this fluid, which displays sentience enough to attack him and infect him in turn.

During his infection, Sel experiences visions through the eyes of [[Evangeline Barnett]] and [[Thomias Blake]] – indicating that they too are infected.

During the events of [[Session 17]], Sel, [[Caeldrid Àrmann an Gealach|Caeldrid]] and [[Gambit]] show [[Jessie 'Doc' Lawrence]] the door of Evangeline and [[Ignatius 'Nate' Barnett|Ignatius Barnett]]'s bedroom – which has been sealed and covered in tendrils of the black fluid. Jessie hypothesises that each instance of the black fluid is merely a small part of a larger organism, and that all those infected are also connected to it.
