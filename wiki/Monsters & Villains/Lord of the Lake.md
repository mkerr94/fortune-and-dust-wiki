# Overview
Colossal, mutated Lenity catfish which attacks the players while they are travelling through the thick fog on [[Lake Lenity]] during the events of [[Session 9]].

The sides and eyes of the creature glow with an ethereal green energy, and it attacks with blind rage. The lights on its body are capable of entrancing prey to enter the water and move willingly to its jaws.

When [[Sel]] enters the Lord of the Lake's body after its defeat during the events of [[Session 10]], he finds a strange, parasitic entity inside. Still writhing inside the corpse of the giant catfish, the substance attempts to corrupt Sel and displays some level of sentience in doing so before he is rescued by [[Caeldrid Ã€rmann an Gealach|Caeldrid]].

> _Sickness... pain... rage... I will devour... I will consume... everything..._
