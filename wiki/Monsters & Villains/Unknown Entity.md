#monster #clements-hollow 

# Overview

A formless, black malice encountered by [[Sel]] while inhabiting the body of [[Evangeline Barnett]] during [[Session 14]]. The creature appears to sneer, but is repelled by Evangelineâ€™s touch.

After the defeat of [[Jessie 'Doc' Lawrence|Jessie Lawrence]] in [[Session 24]], the Players witness some of the black fluid from those infected around [[Clement's Hollow]] coalesce into a barely-formed mass which appears to bear a malevolent face. It is driven off by the hydromancy of [[Rel-se]] and the Lakeside [[Marismente]], attempting a last retreat to the bedroom of Evangeline Barnett before being finally crushed by her.
