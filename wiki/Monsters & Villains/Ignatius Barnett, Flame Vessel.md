# Overview

Enraged Genasi form of [[Ignatius 'Nate' Barnett|Ignatius Barnett]] that confronts the players in [[Session 15]]. Ignatiusâ€™ usually pallid skin appears to harden and blacken like onyx, streaked by bands of burning amber in ancient Genasi patterns long forgotten. His eyes glow bright orange and his hands and head become wreathed in flame.
