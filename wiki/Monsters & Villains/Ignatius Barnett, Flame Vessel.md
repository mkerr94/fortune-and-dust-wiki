# Overview

Enraged Genasi form of [[Ignatius 'Nate' Barnett|Ignatius Barnett]] that confronts the players in [[Session 15]]. 

During [[Session 16]], Ignatius besets the players and nearly brings upon them the fire and ruin he promised. However, [[Sel]], speaking to him as a friend, manages to break through the rage that has consumed him. This causes Ignatius, in a last-ditch attempt to regain control of himself, to run toward the bottle-green waters of Lake Lenity and douse the flame that consumes him. When cooled by the water, the effort renders him unconscious – and he slumps to his side.

# Description

Ignatius’ usually pallid skin appears to harden and blacken like onyx, streaked by bands of burning amber in ancient Genasi patterns long forgotten. His eyes glow bright orange and his hands and head become wreathed in flame.
