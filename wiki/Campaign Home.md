# World Intro

Welcome, to ***Fortune & Dust***.

[[Alcadena]] is a vast swathe of land in the new continent of [[Novedeña]], with the Sea of Swords off of it's eastern shoreline

The geography includes labyrinthine mountain ranges, tidal lakes, cloying swamps, thundering rivers, eerie mist-woods, and vast stretches of sun-scorched prairie

In this era, rainfall is extremely scarce and rarely productive, this has led to a huge reliance on imported food from the Faerunian mainland

The population is made of Faerunian settlers both common and wealthy, indigenous Alcadenans, and those simply seeking their fortune in the New World

The society is young and vulnerable to chaos, with the laws of the cities rarely adhered to in the frontier

# Campaign Overview
The campaign will blend aspects of **four** genres:

## Frontier Western
The campaign will take place in a relatively newly-settled (around 200 years BPA) region of a newly-discovered continent.

The region is called [[Alcadena]], the new continent is called [[Novedeña]].

Rudimentary guns and other gunpowder-fueled weaponry will exist in the world.

The geography of the towns, cities and wilderness are defined by the spreading out  of the original settling and the subsequent push West.

In general, the culture is separated between class-divided city populations and hardened pioneers living in the settlements at the frontier.

## Victorian Gothic Horror
Life and death in the New World brings lingering regrets, unnatural ends and melancholic loneliness – and the spectres of the past can often haunt the living

Discovery is a destructive act, and the forging of a new world brings all manner of unnatural things to bear

The ancient land in which the settlers try to build their new lives is bound in mysticism and unknowable things, and these still exist in the forgotten places – sometimes with violence in their hearts

## Steampunk/Retrofuturism
[[Alcadena]] is on the cusp of an industrial revolution – forged by the reaction of fire and water

Steam-powered industry has flourished here and has brought to life several new technologies, possibilities and dangers

The novelty of some of these technologies renders them financially inaccessible to many of the commonfolk – but they are commonplace among the wealthy and educated classes

## High Fantasy
This New World has a history, one steeped in magic and ancient powers

Old Faerunian culture still exists among certain classes in [[Alcadena]], however the skilled use of magic is not widely known and is even suppressed by [[The Protectorate]] in the major settlements without certain affiliations and permissions
