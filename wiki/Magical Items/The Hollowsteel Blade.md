# Overview

Strange sword found by the party after breaking the brittle material surrounding the broken leg of [[The Furnace Spider]].

# Description

The handle is covered in dark grey, bony, ridged material like hardened skin and ends in a deep black orb clutched by metallic spider legs at the hilt. The blade itself is long and thin, and glints with an icy blue. It’s wicked sharpness seems to cut even the air it moves through. At the base of the blade, in spiky lettering is engraved the word *“Hollowsteel”*.

# Item Sheet

Very rare (requires attunement)

Longsword, slashing damage, 1d8

When you attack an object with this magic sword and hit, maximise your weapon damage dice against the target.

When you attack a creature with this weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, that target takes an extra 14 slashing damage. Then roll another d20. If you roll a 20, you lop off one of the target's limbs, with the effect of such loss determined by the GM. If the creature has no limb to sever, you lop off a portion of its body instead.

In addition, you can speak the sword's command word to cause the blade to shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. Speaking the command word again or sheathing the sword puts out the light.

The command word is engraved in spiky lettering on the base of the blade. It reads, “Hollowsteel”.
