# Overview

Mysterious object seen by [[Gambit]] and [[Sel]] during their respective dreams while resting in the [[The Barnett-Blake Ironworks|Barnett-Blake Ironworks]] Living Quarters in [[Session 18]]. It is unclear whether the objects from their dreams are one and the same or separate items of very similar appearance.

The dodecahedron is constructed of strange purple-grey stone-glass with metal inlays of gold and brass. A soft light pulses from within.

In Sel's dream, he found it at the centre of a mysterious underground lair guarded by a shield guardian and an enchanted room. Gambit found the object in his dream of a grand manor house, where it was protected by enchanted suits of armour in the manor's library.
