# The Events of Session 18

[[Caeldrid Àrmann an Gealach|Caeldrid]] accompanies [[Jessie 'Doc' Lawrence|Jessie Lawrence]] to [[Thomias Blake]]'s house to check on Thomias, [[Holden Smith|Holden]] and [[Alvina]]. Greeted by the shining emerald eyes of the Lenity wildcat resting on Thomias' porch, the pair head inside to find Thomias and Holden already in conversation.

>*"I don't know what that was out there but it weren't Nate Barnett. He might be troubled but he's no killer. To lash out like that, especially at you, Tom, it just don't fit. You sure you're not injured?"*

Jessie examines Thomias, and she and Caeldrid notice that, despite being a little bruised and tender, he is otherwise relatively uninjured. Jessie becomes lost in thought and states that she'll return to her surgery to do some research – and call on Caeldrid and the party should she discover anything. At Thomias' insistence, Holden also leaves with Alvina in order to patrol the town and make sure none of the other townsfolk were harmed during the group's fight with Ignatius. Caeldrid and Thomias talk briefly. The halfling explains that Ignatius' actions were extremely out of character, but that he has been deeply troubled ever since [[Evangeline Barnett|Evangeline]] fell ill. Thomias also expresses guilt that he hasn't done more for Evangeline himself, and admits to Caeldrid that he has been doing his best to push events in the town out of his mind. As Caeldrid leaves, he hears Thomias coughing to himself in the back room of his home.

[[Sel]] awakes in an underground tunnel. He notices that his hands and body are not that of a tortle, and that he has pointed ears. Despite his initial confusion, he feels a strong urge to move forward and a great desire for something deeper within the place he finds himself in. He comes to a large circular door guarded by a shield guardian made of steel and wood. Distracting this fearsome watchman and slipping through the door, Sel also works his way past the enchanted room beyond, at last coming to the object of his desire. Focusing his memory for a moment, he recalls a single name somewhere in the forgotten recesses of his mind.

>*"Zelraun..."*

Sel passes into a large cave with a pool of clear water at the centre. On a marble plinth in the middle of the pool, a strange object rests. It is made of a purple-grey material which sometimes seems to be stone, and in certain lights appears to be glass. A soft light pulses from within. It is also wrought with metal inlays of gold and brass along its perfectly geometrical lines – dodecahedral in shape. Sel makes his way up to the object and reaches out to touch it but, as he does, there is a blinding white light and he awakes in the Ironworks Lounge – restored to his tortle body. He removes his parcel of letters from his pack, and finds that a lot of them are addressed to [[Zelraun]].

[[Gambit]] has a similarly restless sleep. In his dreams, he and a group of professional thieves stalk through the hallways of a grand manor house. The group includes his younger brother, [[Edward]], who seems eager to prove himself to Gambit and the rest of the group. Edward refers to Gambit as *"Tidus"*. After the alarm at the manor is raised, the two are instructed by their leader to make for the artefact they are there to steal alone while the rest of the group deal with the guards.

The brothers make their way into a grand library, with Gambit using a strange beetle-like device that Edward says was given to him by someone called [[Yuna]]. Inside the library, they find an object identical in appearance to the one found by Sel during his dream. After taking it, they are attacked by enchanted suits of armour within the library and only make a narrow escape after Edward fashions a hole in one of the exterior walls with a magical piece of chalk. However, as the pair flee, Edward is struck by a seemingly fatal spell and falls to the ground. Gambit notices that the object in his hand begins to glow...

>*"Did we do it brother?"*

Gambit awakes on the floor of the Ironworks Living Quarters. To his horror, thin wisps of the black fluid appear to be reaching out toward him from Evangeline’s door. He and Sel reunite.

Meanwhile, at the [[Shrine of the Forest]], [[Wild Bill]], [[Amotti]], [[Elias Blackwood|Eli]] and [[Lythara Sunstrider|Lythara]] debate the meaning of the strange chamber and whether or not the Lakeside Marismente were aware of it. They question why, if [[Jebediah ‘Jeb’ Clayborn|Jeb]] was put there by the Lakeside Marismente, his whereabouts were not mentioned to them by [[Rel-se]].

Jeb begins to tell [[Sam Clayborn|Sam]], [[Hattie Clayborn|Hattie]] and the group the last things he remembers before waking up. He recounts that he was attacked by the [[Mutant Hounds]] while trying to run away to find his mother [[Marie Clayborn|Marie]]. Afterwards, he remembers only fragments. He remembers being saved by a group of Marismente, unlike those he has seen before at the [[Lakeside Marismente Camp]]. He says they seemed liked soldiers to him. In addition to this, Jeb tells the group that there was a strange girl with them. Seemingly human, her skin had a pale greenish tint to it and her messy red-brown hair was tied with flowers and ivy. Jeb recalls that the Marismente placed a small crown of blue sea-glass on top of the girl’s head - and the lights in the Shrine of Forest began to glow. He explains that he can’t remember anything after that.

Exhausted, the party return to the Inn to sleep and leave Sam, Hattie and Jeb to complete their reunion in private. In the morning, Caeldrid notices that Gambit and Sel did not return to the Inn. At breakfast, the rest of the group begin to debrief over the night’s events as Hattie serves them catfish roe and milk from Slim Ed’s ranch. While she thanks the group and admits they all have a lot of catching up to do, she says that it may have to wait. Hattie reveals that Holden has already stopped by, and passed on a message from [[Magnolia 'Old Mags' Aurix|Old Mags]] that [[Ignatius 'Nate' Barnett|Ignatius Barnett]] has woken up…
