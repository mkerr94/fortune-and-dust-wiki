# The Events of Session 5

The players begin Session 5 in the aftermath of their battle with the [[Mutant Lake-Lizards]]. [[Elias Blackwood|Eli]] and [[Wild Bill]] linger for a while outside the [[Clayborn Inn]], deciding to spend some time alone before joining [[Lythara Sunstrider|Lythara]], [[Amotti]], [[Gambit]], [[Holden Smith|Holden]] and [[Alvina]] in entering. Finding the town otherwise quiet, Wild Bill pauses for a moment and gets the distinct sensation that he is being watched – even catching a fleeting glimpse of movement from a nearby rooftop.

Meanwhile, [[Sel]] and [[Caeldrid Àrmann an Gealach|Caeldrid]] make their way to [[Jessie 'Doc' Lawrence|Jessie Lawrence]]'s home and surgery, at the behest of Sel, intent on making headway in their investigations into the whereabouts of the [[Marismente|Marismentan]] militia and [[Eva Vanderbilt]]. On their way there, they observe [[Issy]] asleep in the rocking chair on her porch, but decide to leave the old Dwarven woman in peace. Finding Jessie somewhat dishevelled but clearly having already been awake before their arrival, Sel plays up his injuries from the lake-lizard attack in order to fashion an opportunity to press the Doc for information relating to the town and the recent events.

From Jessie, the pair learn several things. First, they learn that the local lake-flower Lenitium florana (previously observed by Sel as circled in the corresponding page of Jessie's copy of Lakeside Herbs and Ointments Vol III) has strange medicinal properties. Second, that Issy lived in the area that was to become Clement's Hollow before the founding of the town. Third, they learn that Jessie has a keen interest in the Marismente, however she admits that [[Ignatius 'Nate' Barnett|Nate]] (being the employer of some of the nearby group) is probably a better person to advise on how to talk with them. Finally, albeit hesitantly, Jessie offers insight into the strange sickness suffered by [[Evangeline Barnett]]. Evangeline was first brought to Jessie for diagnosis and treatment, after which, Nate took Evangeline back to the Ironworks and she has not been seen since.

While at the surgery, Sel and Caeldrid decide to check in on [[Thomias Blake]]. Though still unconscious, Thomias shares a telepathic connection with Sel after the latter casts Message on him. Through Thomias' eyes, Sel witnesses a hazy vision of the early days of the town. Thomias, Issy, Nate and Evangeline share some tea while construction takes place around them. Before Sel and Caeldrid leaves, Jessie explains that [[Magnolia 'Old Mags' Aurix|Old Mags]] has visited her already following the lake-lizard attack, and that she has taken [[Whip]]'s body in preparation for his funeral – to be discussed at the town meeting Mags has called for the next afternoon.

The rest of the players, having returned to the Clayborn Inn, discuss the night's events with Holden Smith and a shaken Hattie Clayborn. Apologetic and tearful after being scolded by Amotti on the danger she inadvertently brought to the town, Hattie explains that she was visiting the Old Elm to look for her missing brother, [[Jebediah ‘Jeb’ Clayborn|Jeb]]. She tells Lythara that she and her brother used to play there as kids and that, later on the night he disappeared, she found his riding reigns tied to the ancient tree. Holden bemoans that Hattie has learned he and Alvina's patrol routes well enough to avoid detection at night. On the day he went missing, Jeb was helping [[Slim Ed]] at his ranch with his horse, Brea. After returning home for dinner, he then left in secret during the night, and Hattie later learned from Whip that he hadn't returned Brea to the stables.

With their mother [[Marie Clayborn|Marie]] having also disappeared as few days prior, [[Hattie Clayborn|Hattie]] is worried that Jeb has attempted to pursue her and run into danger. She explains to the players that her father, [[Sam Clayborn|Sam]], is of the opinion that both Marie and Jeb have left for the city [[Portumluna]] – the two having expressed on multiple occasions their desire to travel there and ride the new Vanderbilt Railway. Despite this apparent calmness about the situation, Hattie also reveals that Sam now spends most of his nights in his office reading old letters, and she has even heard him crying when he thinks she is out of earshot.

During this conversation, Sam himself emerges from the door at the back of the inn's bar, half-dressed and clearly woken. He attempts to console Hattie and asks that, while he is grateful for the players custom, they leave his family's business to he and Hattie. With Hattie offering little protest, the players get the sensation that she and her father have argued over Jeb and Marie's disappearance to the point of stalemate.

Exhausted and still processing the events of the night and the new information learned, the players finally decide to retire to their rooms to rest. Woken by the dappled light of the near-midday sun, Eli, Gambit, Amotti and Wild Bill argue over Amotti's perceived harshness to Hattie the previous night – with Eli and Wild Bill attempting to teach Amotti the intricacies of social cues and etiquette. Afterward, Eli becomes frustrated with Gambit and Amotti when they try to talk about him (semi-privately) and leaves when Gambit unsuccessfully attempts to protest their innocence.

At breakfast, the players are served buttered toast, eggs, Lenity catfish roe and fresh milk from Slim Ed's ranch by a visibly brighter Hattie. Asking Hattie for some privacy, Sel attempts to re-focus the group and outline his plans for their first full day in [[Clement's Hollow]]. He explains that the coming town meeting, which Hattie mentions is likely to happen later that afternoon, is an excellent opportunity to meet with key figures in Clement's Hollow and sift for information relevant to their investigations. He encourages each of the party to play to their strengths to this end. Sel asks the party to attempt to cover as many people at the meeting as possible, during which he will assume the guise of a medicinal flora enthusiast, and the party his hired protection. Meanwhile Eli will investigate the town in the absence of its citizens.

The session ends as Hattie informs the players that their second night in the Clayborn Inn is on the house. The party looks to one another, preparing themselves for their first full day in Clement's Hollow – and whatever may await them as it unfolds...
