# The Events of Session 20

The players visit [[Tryst's General Store]]. After some magically-assisted haggling by way of the “suggestion” spell, [[Wild Bill]] receives a new dagger from [[Clarence Tryst|Clarence]] and [[Lythara Sunstrider|Lythara]] and [[Sel]] receive a minor potion of healing each. During their transaction, Clarence reveals his frustration that [[Red]] has vacated his room above the store without paying his last bill. [[Caeldrid Àrmann an Gealach|Caeldrid]] inquires as to whether or not Red left anything behind, which Clarence confirms before inviting the players to head up and see for themselves.

[[Amotti]] and [[Gambit]] head into Red’s room. There they find an empty suitcase and a shelf full of various magical components. Gambit discovers Red’s field journal, and reads the following entry:

> *Disturbance outside Southern Gate of Clement's Hollow. Unknown assailants but unfamiliar group arrived from Portumluna – 4 mage-born confirmed.*
> *Group have taken residence in Clayborn Inn. Purpose unknown.*
> *Movements of Inn Keep toward suspected artefact site tracked by non-mage-born group member 1. Eliminated threat from external wildlife showing signs of unknown contamination, no casualties, town alert level raised.*
> *Change observation route of Inn, possible sighting by non-mage-born group member 2.*
> *No signs of artefact. Ironworks highly secure and operated by skilled mage-born. Worthy of further investigation.*

The entry is marked with the date of the players arrival in [[Clement's Hollow]].

Meanwhile, Amotti packs the magical components into the suitcase and attempts to steal them by levitating them out of the open window using his mage hand. However, Clarence appears at the threshold and states that until his debt is paid he claims ownership over the items Red left behind. Amotti ignores this and casts the suitcase from the room, following close behind by jumping from the window. Clarence pursues him and locks Gambit in the upstairs room.

Outside, Amotti flees upon landing with the suitcase - heading for the Lenity Woods. Clarence tells the rest of the group he has no choice but to hold Gambit captive and contact [[Magnolia 'Old Mags' Aurix|Old Mags]] until his property is returned. The party denounce any responsibility for Amotti’s actions and encourage Gambit to jump from the window and make his escape. Clarence, suddenly feeling all of his 400 years, realises that in a contest of himself against the party he has no hope. Dejected, his previous happy-go-lucky bravado replaced by resignation,  he sets Gambit free and locks up the shop

> *“I guess it’s time old Clarence was packing up and giving up the game anyway. Take what you want, I never want to see you here again.”*

Gambit leaves, taking Red’s ledger with him. The group discuss their next move, and their growing concern that Amotti’s rash actions will one day be their undoing. Delayed after events at the store, the group send Wild Bill to the Inn to cancel their dinner date with the Clayborns. However, [[Hattie Clayborn|Hattie]] strongly insists, and says she and her family are willing to wait until whatever time the group return that night. Wild Bill agrees and promises that they will return for dinner.

The party then pursue Amotti to the [[The Old Elm]], finding him at a loss but still in possession of the case. They discuss with him the needlessness of his theft, to which he argues that amongst the items he stole there could be a critical clue to their investigations. Caeldrid reiterates that, while this might be true, they were invited to look at the items freely and there was no need to steal them. With Amotti continuing to fight his corner, it is eventually Lythara who talks him down with infallible reason and logic. She retrieves the case, which Sel confirms is simply filled with spell components. Sel jokes that, from now on, the party could call themselves “The Suitcase Bandits”.

Investigating the area around the Old Elm, [[Elias Blackwood|Eli]] and Caeldrid cannot discern any point of origin for the tracks of the rogue Marismente and Eva in the thick undergrowth around the clearing. The group re-enter the [[Shrine of the Forest]] and find it seemingly dormant - its  lights extinguished. They leave, resolving to instead visit the [[Lakeside Marismente Camp]].

On the way, Wild Bill briefly returns to town, where the [[Arthur and Neall Carpenter|Carpenter brothers]] Art and Neall deliberate on how best to move the broken door of the [[The Barnett-Blake Ironworks|Barnett-Blake Ironworks]] from the town square. He gives Red’s suitcase to Neall, and asks that he return it to Clarence with the group’s apologies - to which Neall agrees. They enter the Lakeside Camp after passing [[Gur-ak and Sut-ak]] on guard at the entrance. They are not asked to surrender their weapons - a sign that they have gained the trust of the Lakeside Marismente after their defeat of the [[Mutant Lake-Lizards]]. Asking for [[Rel-se]], they are directed out across the water of [[Lake Lenity]], from which they hear the faint sound of a strange singing…
