# The Events of Session 11

As Session 11 opens, the party stand on the shore of the islet in [[Lake Lenity]], having just left the fishing shack. With [[Ignatius 'Nate' Barnett|Ignatius]]' enchanted metronome, pictogram, black pawn chess piece, ornate iron chest and experimental journal in tow, they set out for the far shore on the remaining rowing boats and giant lily pad. As they glide over the now still lake-water through the thinning fog, [[Elias Blackwood|Elias]] spots dark shapes moving under the water in the opposite direction. While some appear to be fish and other lake-dwelling creatures, he also observes two that have large, humanoid shapes.

Reaching the far shore as the night quickens around them, the players discuss their next moves. In particular, they attempt to plot the best course forward for approaching Ignatius Barnett with their findings and whether or not to inform [[Magnolia 'Old Mags' Aurix|Old Mags]] of their discoveries on the island. In the end, they decide to split into two groups and do both. Approaching the Western Gate of [[Clement's Hollow]], the players are let through by three [[Marismente|Marismentan]] guards on patrol – two males walking the perimeter wall and one female manning the gate itself. Re-entering the town, the players find it still and quiet – with adherence to Old Mag's nightfall curfew appearing to be largely upheld by the townsfolk.

Before splitting, the players attempt to find [[Holden Smith]], with [[Caeldrid Àrmann an Gealach|Caeldrid]] sending Gwynevere on a brief scouting flight around the main streets of the town. To his surprise, Gwynevere sees no sign of Holden or [[Alvina]] – both of whom should be patrolling the streets at this time on their watch. However, Gwynevere does spot Issy asleep in her usual chair on her front porch. More curiously, she sees a furtive and anxious-looking [[Clarence Tryst]] closing up the general store – but not without first sending a worried glance up either side of the street upon which the store sits.

With no sign of Holden, the party split. Caeldrid, [[Sel]], Eli and [[Lythara Sunstrider|Lythara]] head to the [[The Barnett-Blake Ironworks|Barnett-Blake Ironworks]] to confront Ignatius, asking [[Amotti]], [[Gambit]] and [[Wild Bill]] to give them a short head-start before they go to the Town Hall to report to Old Mags. Finding the main door to the Ironworks closed, they decide to explore the elevated rear-section of the building. This portion of the Ironworks is raised around 40 ft from the ground on thick, iron girders – with the underside being used for timber and fuel storage. At the front, a short, open bridge with railings connects back to the upper floor of the main section of the Ironworks. At either side of the rear-section, iron steps ascend from the ground up to two walkways that span the left and right walls.

Looking up, they see a faint light coming from a window just to the left-hand side of the connecting bridge. Caeldrid sends Gwynevere up and sees that the window leads to Ignatius Barnett's office, where they were received the previous day. Caeldrid has Gwynevere gently tap the window before retreating to the nearby railing to observe. After a minute, she sees Ignatius peer out into the night, before quickly retreating and closing the drapes behind him. Emboldened by this sighting, Sel marches up the left-hand staircase, Eli and Lythara following behind, and begins loudly rapping on the door they find at the top with his staff. As each blow increases in force with his frustration, the three begin to feel a rumbling emanating from the other side. The rumbling intensifies and continues to intensify, accompanied by an otherworldly groaning from behind the door. Eventually the walls of the building itself seem to almost buckle under the pressure of some great force, before a bright orange light flashes from the office window and the rumbling ceases.

Only emboldened further by this, Sel levitates himself onto the connecting bridge and casts a minor illusion inside the office. The illusion takes the form of his own voice, elevated to booming volume, imploring Ignatius to come out and face their questions in a repeated loop. Persisting with this for minutes without any clear response, the large ornate doors to the office eventually click open. Warily, Sel steps inside, but the door slams shut behind him before the others can follow. 

Inside, Sel finds the office empty. As he moves further in, he feels a great pain in his stomach and sees thick, black liquid seeping from the bookcases on either side of him. His eyes begin to cloud over and he convulses. Before losing consciousness, he experiences a vision of a bedroom. The bedroom is criss-crossed from floor to ceiling by pulsating, thick tendrils of viscous black liquid. He feels a rage growing inside him that is calmed, if only briefly, when he turns to see a small music box spinning beside the bed. On its pedestal, a couple embrace as if in a dance, the man being of ashen skin flecked with orange and the woman of dark skin and raven hair.

Meanwhile, Amotti, Wild Bill and Gambit pass time by gambling for truths. Amotti learns that Bill took the moniker 'Wild' in his reckless younger days. He also learns that Gambit has a younger brother, Edward. In turn, Gambit learns of Wild Bill's true name in secret. With enough time having passed, the trio go to the Town Hall to find Old Mags. They find the hulking dragonborn drinking alone in her office, looking at a pictogram which she quickly puts back in her desk. Mags expresses fear that she is losing a grip on events in Clement's Hollow, and asks what the players have discovered in their investigations. Her temper flares and tensions rise after Amotti reveals to her that he and Gambit stole from Issy, and she warns them that she will not hesitate to imprison them should they have brought harm to the old dwarf.

Mags also balks at the suggestion that Ignatius' is involved in the unnatural dangers facing the town, but is convinced that further investigation is warranted by Wild Bill – whose pragmatism and focus diffuses the situation. She reluctantly grants the trio permission to go and put their questions and evidence to Nate, while she pays a visit to [[Thomias Blake]] – hoping to learn what she can from him as Ignatius' closest friend.

With Mags leaving for Thomias' house, Wild Bill, Amotti and Gambit begin to head toward the Ironworks. As they do, Ralf stops. Hackles raised, he emits a low growl and suddenly barks at something unseen, lurking in the darkness...
