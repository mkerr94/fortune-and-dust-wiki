# The Events of Session 17


[[Ignatius 'Nate' Barnett|Ignatius]] lies unconscious at the shore of [[Lake Lenity]]. As the players look on together with [[Magnolia 'Old Mags' Aurix|Old Mags]], [[Holden Smith|Holden]] and [[Alvina]] they hear a murmuring from behind them. Turning, they see that several of the residents of [[Clement's Hollow]] have gathered near the Western Gate and are beginning to mumble to each other about the night’s events in worried tones. Old Mags snarls at them.

>*“Go back to your homes, the curfew still stands! There’s nothing more to be seen here tonight.”*

With this, Mags stoops to pick up the body of Ignatius. She states that she intends to take him to the cells in the Town Hall, believing him to be of no further threat, and that he will answer for what he’s done when he wakes. Before she leaves, the players warn her of the lingering threat in [[Evangeline Barnett|Evangeline]]’s room. At this, Mags instructs Holden to go and check on [[Thomias Blake|Thomias]] before heading to the [[The Barnett-Blake Ironworks|Barnett-Blake Ironworks]] to investigate.

The gathered townsfolk begin to disperse. Lingering last is [[Jessie 'Doc' Lawrence]], who casts a worried glance at Holden before turning to leave. Before she can, [[Sel]] gets her attention with a telepathic message. She returns, and he asks her to accompany him to the Ironworks so that he can show her what’s become of Evangeline’s room (Evangeline being a former patient of hers). Holden advises caution, and says he’ll join them as soon as he’s checked that Thomias is ok.

The group make their way back into the town. On the way, they notice that Thomias is no longer lying where he was thrown against a wall by Ignatius’ fireball, with Holden and Alvina also nowhere to be seen. The players decide to split up. [[Caeldrid Àrmann an Gealach|Caeldrid]] and Gambit accompany Sel and Jessie Lawrence to Evangeline's room in the Ironworks Living Quarters.

Jessie is fascinated by what she sees there. She marvels at the strange tendrils of [[The Black Fluid]] covering Evangeline's door, and hypothesises that they may all be part of one living creature – like separate fruit of the same fungus. In response to this, Sel decides to try to demonstrate his symptoms to the doctor. Closing his eyes and attempting to focus his mind on the infection inside him, he feels a formless malice trying to claw at the backs of his eyes. To Caeldrid, [[Gambit]] and Jessie, Sel appears to convulse for a moment as a single black tear rolls from his eye. Jessie observes this with wonder and, after collecting a sample of the tear in a small glass vial, she places her hands on Sel's face and successfully brings him back to consciousness by appealing to his waking mind.

On waking, Sel reveals to Jessie that as part of his symptoms he has experienced visions through the eyes of both Evangeline and Thomias. While initially pensive, considering that this fact perhaps confirms her hypothesis that the black fluid and those infected by it are all connected to the same organism, Jessie becomes worried that Holden may be in danger as he was sent by Mags to check on Thomias. Upon this realisation, she decides to leave and investigate, accompanied by Caeldrid. Gambit and Sel decide to stay behind and rest after searching the remainder of the Ironworks for any useful items. On the exterior bridge, Jessie stops Caeldrid for a moment.

> *"Now I don't mean to add any more worry where there's enough already, sugar, but you should know this. They brought Evangeline to me first, when she got sick. I'd never seen anything like it before but, your friend, what's happening to him now is just how it started with her."*

Meanwhile, [[Wild Bill]], [[Elias Blackwood|Eli]], [[Amotti]] and [[Lythara Sunstrider|Lythara]] return to the [[Clayborn Inn]]. As they approach, they see that the front of the inn is dark, save for only the faintest of lights catching and reflecting on the glass of the front windows from within. Outside, Rusty Jack whinnies and grunts restlessly, pulling on the harness holding him to the porch banister. Wild Bill notices that his food and water hasn't been refreshed and decides to lead him on a brief walk around the streets to soothe him. Entering the reception, the rest of the group find it unmanned and eerily quiet. They see that the light is coming from the bar at the rear of the building, and inside they find a drunk and sobbing [[Sam Clayborn]].

> *"Oh, it's you folks. You'll join me for a drink, won't you? Sure you will. I told Hattie everything, you know. About Marie, and her... sickness. About Marie's letter and how she made me promise not to tell until she was gone. She screamed at me, and the she left. She said you're a coward and a drunk, Sam Clayborn, and on both accounts I am guilty, god save me. I tried to tell her that I was sorry, that I wish I was strong like her and her mother, but she wouldn't listen. She says she's gone to find our Jebediah, out in the Lenity Woods, by that tree they used to play around as weans. My boy Jeb, I've left him all on his own."*

The players decide to go out and find [[Hattie Clayborn|Hattie]]. Eli hands Sam his rapier and tells him to take courage. The party head to [[Lenity Woods]], regrouping with Wild Bill at the Western Gate.

They approach the entrance to Lenity Woods. Looming over them, as if in inspection of an unwanted guest, the trees hunch at the Wood's edge. Stooping at their apex into a slight curve, their canopy shelters the path below in a dappled gloom – still visible despite now being strewn with debris after Eli and Hattie were chased by the [[Mutant Lake-Lizards]].

On the path to the [[The Old Elm]], the players encounter a small, white mouse which darts out in front of them. It looks up briefly before disappearing into the undergrowth, and they see that it has unusual glowing orange eyes.

They eventually reach a clearing in the trees. Moving into it, the group sees the towering, gnarled shape of the Old Elm at its centre. From the thick base of the tree, a hundred ancient roots snake their way out into the clearing - ever dipping above and below ground and entangling with each other. Looking upward, straining their necks to do so, they see the canopy above splayed out like the wings of a great bird on the wind.

At regular intervals around the clearing, four large standing stones are embedded into the ground below. Standing vigil like giant's tombstones, they face the Old Elm at the centre. Although difficult to make out, each seems to be carved with some weathered motif almost faded beyond recognition. At the base of the one nearest to the group, knees up to her chest and head buried in crossed arms, Hattie Clayborn gently sobs to herself.

The players try to convince Hattie to return with them to the town, observing that the woods are no longer safe at night. She remains steadfast, and states that (hopeless or no) she intends to remain by the Old Elm until she finds [[Jebediah ‘Jeb’ Clayborn|Jeb]] or he returns – no matter the cost. In an attempt to frighten Hattie into heading back with them, Amotti conjures the image of a phantom with his dancing lights. Hattie grabs Eli's rapier from Sam and pushes her behind him, facing down this strange enemy. Seeing Amotti's deception, Eli decides to reveal the trick to Hattie, and begrudgingly agrees to help her investigate the area around the Old Elm if she promises to come back to the inn with them afterward.

First, the party investigate the standing stones. They see that each of the stones is carved with a weathered and faded symbol of a great tree. Beneath this, is the image of two catfish encircled, one pursuing the other in an endless dance. At the centre of this motif, is a small, marble shaped hole. From this, lines carved in the stone spread as veins through the back of a hand.

The ground in front of each stone appears to have been disturbed and the group find multiple sets of footprints - some large and some small. The larger footprints appear to be webbed at the toe, and the smaller appear to be human – from their size most likely female. The tracks are deepest in front of each stone, however they appear to lead away from them and converge around the back of the Old Elm.

Coming to a sudden realisation, Wild Bill approaches a stone and places the sea-glass bead he was given by [[Rel-se]] in the [[Lakeside Marismente Camp]] into the small opening. It begins to glow a deep blue and casts a light out into the clearing. Slowly, the bead begins to spin and revolve in its setting – before its surface seems to bubble and foam as if it were the source of some spring. Water wells in the indentation, and then spreads out through the carved lines on the standing stone. The others do the same with their beads, and their light shines on the Old Elm. The ground begins to rumble. As if in answer, the roots of the Old Elm begin to quiver,  accompanied by the scraping of wood through earth as some at the rear of the tree begin to contract and shift.

Moving toward the back of the tree, the group find an opening in the ground below where some of the roots have shifted. Impossibly, the entrance appears to be served by stone steps leading down into the darkness. From within, a pale blue light shimmers like ripples on the surface of a forest pond in the moonlight.

They descend the steps. A sound like bubbling water rises from within the chamber ahead and the pale blue light grows stronger. Eventually, they reach an underground plateau. The floor is made of packed earth and littered with leaves and branches. Above is a net and tangle of ancient roots, indicating they are now directly beneath the Old Elm itself. Dust falls lightly from the ceiling as the roots re-settle. The pale blue light now mixes with one of electric green, the same green the players have previously seen sparking through the fog of Lenity Lake.

Looking at the walls, the players see that the green light is emanating from carvings made into the earth of the chamber. They seem to depict animals (a rabbit, a lake-lizard, and a wild-cat). Wild Bill makes a hasty note of these carvings. In the centre of the chamber, there's a raised platform, into which is carved a bath filled with a pool of glowing water from which the blue light is coming. Lying inside, half-submerged, the players find a skinny boy of ivory pale skin. Roughly dressed in travelling gear and with a shock of brown hair, his eyes and brow twitch – as if in some restless dream.

Hattie immediately recognises the boy as her brother Jeb and runs to his side, soon joined by Sam. Together, they lift him from the pool and lay him on the floor of the chamber. Jeb begins to mumble about his Ma, and Brea (his horse). With Hattie's permission, Lythara checks him over and finds horrific slash marks on his chest – now closed over and healed. Wondering, Eli places his hand (scratched from the fight with Ignatius) into the pool – but nothing seems to happen. As he ponders this, a faint ragged voice is heard from behind him.

>*"Hattie... is that you?"*
