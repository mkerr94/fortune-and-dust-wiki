# The Events of Session 19

[[Lythara Sunstrider|Lythara]], [[Amotti]], [[Elias Blackwood|Eli]] and [[Wild Bill]] finish talking with [[Hattie Clayborn|Hattie]] after having breakfast at the [[Clayborn Inn]]. During their conversation, Amotti mentions that he has a sister – who he believes to still be in Faerun, and with whom he is in no great hurry to reunite. Hattie appears grateful for the Player's help in recovering her brother, but seems lost in thought and somewhat distant.

>*"So much has already happened since Jeb went missing. Pa and I told him about Ma last night... and Whip too. He didn't say much, he just kind of nodded as if he already knew... somehow. He's gone to the stables to check on the horses, I want to go to him but I just think we need to let him be for a little while..."*

Apologising for her distractedness, Hattie invites the Players for dinner that evening with herself, [[Sam Clayborn|Sam]] and [[Jebediah ‘Jeb’ Clayborn|Jeb]] – as small thanks for their part in Jeb's finding. Before leaving the Players to their business, Hattie issues one last humble request of them.

>*"One more thing, if you'll permit me to say it. Ignatius has done so much for this place, we owe it all to him, Thomias and Evangeline. Whatever he may have done, whatever kind of trouble he might be in... I think he deserves our forgiveness."*

Meanwhile, [[Caeldrid Àrmann an Gealach|Caeldrid]] goes to find [[Sel]] and [[Gambit]] at the Living Quarters of the [[The Barnett-Blake Ironworks|Barnett-Blake Ironworks]]. The three discuss what is to be done with [[Evangeline Barnett|Evangeline]] and the mysterious black fluid ([[The Black Fluid]]) surrounding her bedroom door. During their discussions, they note that the tendrils shifting around the frame of the door appear now seemingly dormant in the mid-morning light. They decide to join the rest of the group in their questioning of [[Ignatius 'Nate' Barnett|Ignatius Barnett]], leaving the guarding of the door to Gwynevere and a remodelled Ralph – who now takes the form of a tall, metal homunculus.

The rest of the group leave the Inn and resolve to heed [[Magnolia 'Old Mags' Aurix|Old Mags]]'s message to proceed to the Town Hall lock-up and hear the testimony of Ignatius Barnett. However, they decide to first check on Jeb Clayborn at the town stables. They find the young stable-hand there looking wistful and taking comfort with the large, black destrier that Wild Bill earlier expressed interest in purchasing from Old Mags. Jeb recounts to the group his strange lack of surprise upon hearing of his mother's passing. He tells them that, while unconscious in the [[Shrine of the Forest]], he experienced a vivid dream in which his mother appeared to him. Surrounded by an aura of peace and an ethereal glow, she bent to gently kiss her son on the cheek and assure him that everything would be ok. Jeb admits that, after this vision, he knew in his heart that [[Marie Clayborn|Marie]] was gone.

Lythara, still curious as to Jeb's memories of his encounter with the strange group of Marismente and the human girl who accompanied them, shows Jeb the pictogram of [[Eva Vanderbilt]] appended to her copy of the [[Vanderbilt Contract]]. Jeb furrows his brow, before his eyes widen. He recognises Eva. She is the same girl of pale-green skin and rough red hair whom he saw crowned in sea-glass by the Marismentan militia in the Shrine of Forest. The group have their first lead on the whereabouts of the target of their search.

Before leaving the stables, Jeb reveals that (with [[Whip]] now deceased) it is his intention to ask Mags if he can take charge of the [[Clement's Hollow]] stables as their new master. He and Wild Bill discuss horses, and the fact that Whip was never fond of naming his. Wild Bill tells Jeb of his companionship with Rusty Jack, and how he is so much more than just a tool to him. Jeb listens intently, and promises to name the next steed he chooses for himself after the loss of Brea.

Meeting in the main square outside the stables and the Ironworks, the party finally reunite as one and make their way to see Ignatius. They are greeted at the Town Hall by Old Mags, who shows them to Ignatius' cell. The Players find Ignatius Barnett shackled and still in his fire-genasi form. His hair, previously alive and aflame, has now returned to its inky black – slicked back tight against his scalp. Still wearing his pinstripe trousers and black waistcoat, his skin has not returned to the form in which the Players first met him. Faint lines of amber in ancient patterns long forgotten wind their way in swirls through the polished black onyx of his skin – catching the light as if Ignatius himself were made of one seamless piece of jet-black crystal.

He stirs a little on the approach of his guests and lifts his hands.

>*"Shackled in my own iron. At least the poetry of it isn't entirely lost on me..."*

He pulls his head forward and opens his eyes, which remain without iris and resemble two fiery-orange jewels resting in their sockets.

>*"So, you finally see me as I truly am. So many years since that night in the library, I'd almost forgotten what I was trying to hide. Well, as your friend rightly guessed, here I am. A son of fire, and one of the only of my kind in all of Alcadena. I know I've caused great hurt, and for that I am truly sorry. Especially to you, Mags, and Thomias. You all deserved better of me. Is Thomias... ok?"*

Caeldrid informs Ignatius that Thomias is unusually well despite the force of the spell he was struck by, which he finds puzzling. Ignatius asks for information on the current situation of Evangeline, if his wife is even still alive. He expresses that his interest in his own safety has now ceased, and he only cares for saving her. Old Mags tells him that she believes the Players can help, but that in order to do so he must now tell them all that he knows.

>*"Then I need to start from the beginning..."*

Ignatius sighs, and stoops his head. Slowly, deliberately, he begins to recount the events leading up to his confrontation with the Players.

>*"It started with the Rail Company. We received a letter from them proposing a partnership with the Ironworks to provide the tracks for their expansion. We thought the Craftsman had answered our prayers. Cornelius Vanderbilt himself came to Clement's Hollow to personally oversee the agreement. Evangeline and I hosted him for dinner. Imagine, a member of the Alcadenan Senate in our home, in the town that we built, it felt like the dream we had back in Samosetia was about to come true – a future forged in steel. We signed the agreements and started production. Tom would make regular trips to Portumluna with Whip to meet with their executives. At Vanderbilt's request, Protectorate presence out at Fortuna was increased, I guess they wanted to make sure the town was guarded. Hell, when those Tecs came to warn us about the Marismentan militia spotted outside of town, it was the first time we'd seen one since the town was built!"*

Old Mags interrupts to express her disdain for the [[The Protectorate|Protectorate]], and reiterates that she has not received any word from the nearby [[Fortuna Outpost]] (20 miles west of Clement's Hollow) after writing to them for aid after the attack of the [[Mutant Lake-Lizards]]. Ignatius listens carefully, then continues.

>*"Be that as it may, the whole affair made us feel like we were finally on the map. The work was hard, but production was proceeding as planned. Until Evangeline fell sick. First it was headaches. Then bad dreams. Evangeline would wake in the night, whispering in some dark voice. Soon after she started producing black tears from her eyes, and coughing up the same. I took her to Jessie first. I remember that night so clearly, the first drop of rain in months. We put Evangeline on the treatment table in Jessie's surgery. I'd never seen that look in Jessie's eyes, wide with terror... and wonder. I knew then she'd never seen this before, and that she couldn't help us. She seemed more interested in the sickness itself than helping Evangeline."*

Old Mags again chides Ignatius for the unfairness of this, reminding him that, while Jessie might have knowledge and skill beyond her years, she is still young and relatively inexperienced. Her contributions to the town by way of caring for its citizens is deserving of more respect.

>*"In any case, I knew then that if I wanted to save my wife then I'd have to do it myself. I took her back to our home and started my research. I set up in the old fishing shack I bought from Issy, and started experimenting with my pyromancy - how it could affect living things. If I could use it to cure her. I had less time than I thought. In around a week Evangeline lost consciousness and I knew it was now or never, that’s when you arrived in town.”*

Caeldrid points out the fact that, Evangeline aside, other signs of the black sickness have been all too present in town. The mutated monsters the party have fought testify to this, as well as the infection of Sel after his encounter with the [[Lord of the Lake]]. Mags bristles at this conversation, previously unaware that Sel was infected. Ignatius narrows his eyes, locks them to Caeldrid's, and delivers his final conclusion.

>*“What you need to understand is this. Ever since Evangeline fell sick, I’ve kept her in our bedroom under lock and key. I’ve been with her every day. Nothing has gone in, and nothing has come out save for me. If that’s the case, there’s something that’s been gnawing at me ever since you arrived. These mutated animals, the things that killed Whip and the Lake-lizards that attacked you at the Western Gate. The cattle missing from Ed’s ranch. Your friend, Sel. I swear to you none of it was my doing, and it can’t have come from Evangeline. There’s some other source of this sickness, some will or agent of it, and it’s still loose. If what you say is true, and we can’t get to Evangeline any more, it may be our only chance of helping her. I think the reason it’s sealed her door is that it’s come under threat and accelerated- like a virus. If you can find whatever is behind the spread of this thing here in Clement’s Hollow, and confront it, it may force its hand and draw it away from Evangeline.  I’ve no right to ask it of you, but I can’t be trusted in my current state, it has to be you”.*

At this, Sel feigns a need for some fresh air and, while Mags is hesitant to let them go, he, Caeldrid and Amotti leave the Town Hall and go to Thomias Blake's house. They find him in a restless, feverish sleep. Waking, he attempts to downplay the progression of his infection. Caeldrid asks him when he thinks it started, to which Thomias replies that he is unsure but has felt this way ever since regaining consciousness after being attacked. He worries that the party are accusing him of being behind the unnatural events in town, to which he pleads that he has been unconscious and injured since their arrival. Caeldrid assures him that this is not the case, but as a precaution he and Sel convince Thomias to go to the Town Hall and incarcerate himself – in the event that he poses a risk to himself or others before things in Clement's Hollow can be put right.

The rest of the group leave Ignatius and the Town Hall, but not before Lythara retrieves the remaining two extinguished fire-opals from Old Mags. In the dragonborn's office, the Players catch a glimpse of a photograph she keeps hidden away – depicting an old half-orc woman of weathered face and braided blonde hair. Before leaving, Wild Bill implores Mags to let Jeb take charge of the stables - to which she agrees.

The party regroup once more in the town square and discuss everything that they have learnt, closer now to curing the Curse of Clement's Hollow than they have ever been. They agree that they should now pursue the leads they have not only on the continued spread of the black sickness, but also on the whereabouts of Eva and the Marismentan militia. Wild Bill questions [[Red]]'s involvement, and suggests speaking to [[Clarence Tryst|Clarence]] at [[Tryst's General Store]]. Lythara suggests perhaps visiting [[Rel-se]] and the [[Lakeside Marismente Camp]]. Eli puts forward that many of the strange events have centred around [[Lenity Woods]], and that they may warrant further exploration. As these discussions go on, the midday sun rises in the sky above their heads. Six hours until sunset, and they have a dinner date to keep...
