# The Events of Session 16

The Players continue their flight from [[Ignatius Barnett, Flame Vessel]] and his [[Fire-opal Golems]]. [[Lythara Sunstrider|Lythara]] and [[Caeldrid Àrmann an Gealach|Caeldrid]] stand before the Checkmate Door, trading blows with Ignatius while the others try to make their escape from the exterior bridge. [[Gambit]], having been tossed by [[Amotti]] over the side, is missed by [[Wild Bill]] and [[Elias Blackwood|Eli]] and crashes to the ground with a thud – the slowing of his momentum afforded by Amotti's telekinetic pull the only thing saving him from certain death.

Despite a brave defence to buy their companions time, Caeldrid and Lythara are eventually overwhelmed by Ignatius and the golems. They pull themselves from the melee, fielding several blows from their pursuers, and join the party at the bottom of the rope. Wounded and spent, the Players make their way out into the plaza before the [[The Barnett-Blake Ironworks|Barnett-Blake Ironworks]] Main Door. The wind howls in the chill of the night outside. As if some otherworldly malice, long dormant, has been stirred. At the Western Gate toward [[Lake Lenity]], and along the Main Street, the gas-lamps of [[Clement's Hollow]] burn ever brighter – their flames engorged and swollen.

From behind the Players comes a terrible wrenching sound of contorted metal as the Main Door of the Barnett-Blake Ironworks is rent and spat from its setting. It lands with a thud in the hardened mud of the street, and from inside steps Ignatius Barnett, Flame Vessel. Around the enraged genasi, the Fire-Opals swirl in hypnotic circles. Ignatius breathes heavily and hunches his shoulders, his glowing orange eyes searching in the night. Settling on the group, he lets out a cry of hollow anger and pain, consumed by the fire within his blood.

From the Main Street, four figures come running through the swirling fog. It's [[Magnolia 'Old Mags' Aurix|Old Mags]], [[Thomias Blake]], [[Holden Smith]] and [[Alvina]] the Lenity Wildcat. Old Mags’ eyes widen when she sees Ignatius and two jets of emerald flame shoot from her flared nostrils. Alvina hisses, raises her hackles and moves to pounce but Holden grabs her with both arms around her neck before she can, shouting "No girl!". Thomias looks on defeated, his eyes pale and damp.

> *"Nate? Please stop, if not for me, for Evy's sake."*

Ignatius turns to Thomias and, just for a second, his face slackens and his eyes dim. Opening his mouth as if to speak, instead he strengthens his resolve and hurls ball of flame at the scruffy halfling. It catches Thomias full in the chest and sends him careening into the wall of a nearby building. Mags runs to Tom's side and stoops. When she looks up, she shouts to Holden.

> *"Open the gate! We have to get Nate away from the town or he'll burn it all!"*

Holden nods and looks at the party. He calls Alvina with a whistle to his heel and runs to the Western Gate.

The party, reinforced by Holden, Alvina and Old Mags, continue to battle Ignatius and the reformed golems. In a terrible twist, Ignatius manages to use his pyromancy corporis to briefly gain control of Lythara. Under this influence, she attempts to kill Amotti, but he is saved when Holden distracts Ignatius with a shot from his rifle, releasing Lythara from his hold. With the party failing and close to ruin, [[Sel]] turns to Ignatius. He speaks to him softly of saving the town, saving Evangeline, and extends a hand of friendship. Recognition flickers in Ignatius' face.

> *"Be seeing you, Sel d'Issan..."*

Clutching his face and running, Ignatius flees and blasts through the Western Gate of the town toward Lake Lenity. Old Mags and the Players follow. Beyond the gate, the waves of the lake crash against the shoreline, its wroth whipped up by the wind – which sends the lake-fog spiralling into the night. Moonlight breaks upon the surface of the water, shimmering milky-white against bottle-green. To the left of the players, the faint lights of the [[Lakeside Marismente Camp]] huddle together in the darkness. To their right, the shadows of the [[Lenity Woods]] rise from the ground like sentinels – observing and observing. In front of them, they see Ignatius run toward the water.

There is an ear-splitting hiss as if of steam being released from a great kettle. Ignatius calls out in anguish, his voice trailing away to a crackling wheeze as the orange glow of his eyes dims and his irises roll back in his head. The impenetrable black onyx crystal of his skin, spun with its lines of searing amber, seems to soften and cool. With a sigh, Ignatius falls to his knees and slumps to his side. From his lips, thin wisps of ragged breath condense in the night air and rise to join the swirling lake-fog...
