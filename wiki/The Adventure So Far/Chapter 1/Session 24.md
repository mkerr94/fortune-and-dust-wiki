# The Events of Session 24

The Players are locked in battle with the terrible, mutated form of [[Jessie 'Doc' Lawrence|Jessie Lawrence]] ([[Jessie Lawrence (Mutated Form)]]). She continues to hurl debris from the flaming roof of [[Tryst's General Store]] in an uncontrollable rage. Meanwhile, the [[The Fragments|Fragments]] continue to feverishly scuttle around the main square, attempting to feed on the group. One manages to land a blow on Caeldrid and, while he is distracted, Jessie strikes him with a thrown section of roof. Caeldrid slumps to his knees.

With a last-ditch effort, Eli manages to pierce a weak point under the monstrous, mutated arm of his foe with two pin-point crossbow bolts. Jessie visibly weakens and begins to pant. Rushing forward, Amotti goes to Caeldrid’s aid and brings him round with a healing touch. He then turns his eyes to Jessie and, with a last burst of magical energy, brings down upon her a ferocious beam of glittering moonlight. Enveloped, Jessie screams to the sky as her twisted form is stripped from her by the purifying light. When it fades, for a single, final moment Jessie is illuminated against the darkening sky in her natural Firbolg form - before the light leaves her and she falls from the roof. She lands in a puddle on the cold ground as the intensifying rain falls from above, and is still.

A silence falls, penetrated only by the falling rain. The players look to each other as Gambit emerges with Ralph from the Ironworks. Slowly at first, they begin to notice a gathering darkness. From the fallen body of Jessie Lawrence, and from the Town Hall, a blackness begins to materialise and coalesce in the main square. Sel hunches forward and begins to splutter, a black fluid spilling from his throat and eyes. When it leaves him, he falls unconscious and is picked up by Caeldrid. In the centre of the square, the black mass begins to take shape. The Players see a wicked, inhuman face - malevolence incarnate. It turns its gaze to them and appears to smile, readying itself for an assault. However, at the moment it seems to be about to thrust itself forward, it is struck by a forceful jet of water. The first jet is then joined by another, and another. From all around the players, [[Marismente|Marismentan]] soldiers appear from side streets with arms stretched forward. They appear to draw water from the rain itself and redirect it with terrifying force at the gathering malevolence. They are joined by [[Rel-se]] who, at great strain, adds her strength to theirs. With one last push, the Marismente drive their jets of water into the creature and it dissipates into the air - leaving only a concentrated slug-like remnant floating at its centre.

Rel-se falls to her knees, her eyes clouding over. Weakened to the point of exhaustion, she is gathered by her followers and lifted toward the Western Gate and the [[Lakeside Marismente Camp]] beyond. Meanwhile, the Players see the black slug wriggle for a second in the air and then shoot past Gambit into the Ironworks. One by one, terrified townsfolk begin to emerge from their homes. Taking charge, Lythara orders them to go back to their homes for their own safety, and none refuse her authority. Before the crowd disperses, Eli asks [[Arthur and Neall Carpenter]] to carry the body of [[Magnolia 'Old Mags' Aurix|Old Mags]] into the Town Hall - before which Caeldrid solemnly covers her in his cloak. The Player’s decide to pursue the slug-like remnant into the Ironworks, but first seek the help of Ignatius Barnett. Before leaving, Amotti heals the party, including bringing Sel back to consciousness, with a prayer.

They re-enter the Town Hall cells to find [[Ignatius 'Nate' Barnett|Ignatius]] pleading for help for [[Thomias Blake|Thomias]], who they see has been drained in a similar fashion to Sel and lies unconscious. He is stabilised by Caeldrid, and the Players begin to talk with Nate. Upon hearing of the slug-like creature heading for the Ironworks, Nate begs the Players to release him to allow him to go to [[Evangeline Barnett|Evangeline]]. They disagree on how wise this is and whether or not Nate can be trusted. Lythara asks, if Evangeline is a danger that must be dealt with, whether Nate has the fortitude to do so. He refuses.  Caeldrid eventually takes charge, and systematically works through a ring of keys that he retrieved from the body of Old Mags to try and release Ignatius - resisting the attempts of Amotti to stop him. He finally opens Ignatius’ cell and receives his thanks.

Making sure Thomias is stable, the Players and Nate leave together for the Ironworks. They ascend the stairs and cross the exterior bridge to the Living Quarters. Approaching Evangeline’s room, they see that the black fluid previously covering it is now gone. From a chain around his neck, Ignatius produces a diamond-shaped key that matches the inlaid pattern on the door. He places it in the lock and turns it, pushing open the door to the room beyond. Inside, the players see a lovingly furnished bedroom. Standing, drenched in sweat, one hand outstretched to stabilise herself on the dressing table, is Evangeline Barnett. Her raven-black hair is pushed back, sticking to her dark skin. She takes long, ragged breaths and looks down at her feet. Crushed under her toes and melting into nothingness is the black slug-like creature. A light seems to fade from around Evangeline as she looks up at Ignatius and the Players.

> “Nate? Oh my, I… I feel I’ve had the most terrible dream. You… you’ve changed back. How you were when we first met. So beautiful. Why do you look so scared, my love? Come here to me.”

The Players look on as Ignatius, bewildered and tears pooling in his amber eyes, steps forward toward his wife. His tears begin to evaporate in small puffs of steam against his warm Genasi skin. Sobbing, he pulls Evangeline close and rests his forehead on hers.

> “I’m so sorry my angel, I’m sorry for everything.”

Gently, Evangeline whispers comfort to him and pulls him into her embrace. She places his hand over her belly and they pull closer. She then notices the Players.

> “Who are our guests? You could’ve warned me.”

Caeldrid indicates that another time may be best for introductions, and gestures to the Players that they leave their hosts to their reunion. Before they go, Lythara implores Nate that the town needs leadership and someone to look to. Ignatius puts his arm around Evangeline and one hand on her pregnant belly.

> “I’ve no right to ask it of him, but look to Thomias. He’s ready, and my place is here.”

Ignatius mouthes a silent ‘thank you’ to the party and they leave, turning back for one last look at the reunited lovers. Ignatius props open a small music box on the dressing table and holds Evangeline close. She places her head gently on his chest as they sway to the twinkling music, enrobed in a peace and blissful moment known only to those who, cruelly halved, find themselves once again whole.
