# The Events of Session 22

> *A soft rain falls on [[Clement's Hollow]]. Whispers on the wisps of lake-fog portend a coming fear.  Townsfolk huddle behind closed doors, breath held, waiting on a doom they can neither speak nor name. Somewhere in the night, the seeds of darkness are taking root.*

> *A lamp burns in the window of the [[Clayborn Inn]]. Inside, our strange company lean in towards an unexpected visitor. In his large, scaly hand he holds a small bead of cloudy-blue sea-glass on a broken cord. So small, so unassuming - and yet it heralds the uncovering of mysteries and the unravelling of a terrible fate.*

> *[[Wild Bill]], [[Lythara Sunstrider|Lythara]], [[Sel]], [[Gambit]], [[Amotti]], [[Caeldrid Àrmann an Gealach|Caeldrid]] and [[Elias Blackwood|Eli]]. Your hosts, the Clayborn family, and their visitor, [[Slim Ed]], look to you expectantly. In their eyes, and in your own hearts, an unspoken anxiety grows. Their time, and yours, is running out.*

The players leave the Clayborn Inn and travel to the [[Lakeside Marismente Camp]] with the intention of showing the bead discovered by Slim Ed to [[Rel-se]] and learning from her who it was given to. Arriving at the camp, they find Rel-se and some senior Marismente of the camp in counsel around the central fire-pit. Among the other tents and carts of the camp, the Players see the worried faces of several younger Marismente eager to eavesdrop on the events being discussed. Like Clement's Hollow itself, there is palpable tension in the air.

Rel-se welcomes the Players and gestures for them to speak. Wild Bill shows Rel-se the bead, and Lythara asks her if she knows who it was given to or where it came from. Rel-se's expression turns grave and she stands, beckoning to the players to follow her. She leads them through the camp, out of the main huddle of tents and toward a larger structure slightly segregated from the others. Inside, it becomes clear that this is a medical tent, and the ground is occupied by the sick-beds of several injured and infirmed Marismente. The players observe some Marismentan healers using hydromancy to soothe the wounds and fevers of some of the infirmed.

Rel-se leads the Players toward one particular patient at the rear of the tent. He is an adult male, attended to by a female juvenile. Lying on a bed of woven bark and moss, the Players see that he is bandaged around the torso secured by a metal safety pin – quite unlike the treatment of any of the other patients. At Rel-se's behest, he lifts his coverings to reveal a nasty gash in his torso (seemingly from an animal attack), which has been nimbly stitched with twine – again unlike the healing style of the Marismente. This patient has been healed by Faerunian hands. As the players ponder what this means, Amotti soothes the aches of an injured Marismente using Cure Wounds, and receives a grateful response. However, he fails to achieve the same effect when trying the spell on a feverish patient.

Seeing the players confusion, Rel-se walks to a nearby side table and retrieves an object that was likely left there by the bandaged patient's healer. It is a single flower of the [[Lenitium Florana]]. Sel's memory is stirred. He has seen this flower before. He has read about its healing properties in a book belonging to someone. He has seen a vase full of this same flower in the home of the only person in town who could have treated the bandaged Marismente in this fashion. It must have been for this treatment that they were awarded a sea-glass bead by Rel-se, in gratitude for their help. He deduces that the bead must have belonged to [[Jessie 'Doc' Lawrence]].

The group look at each other with worried eyes and question whether Jessie could really have been behind the theft of Slim Ed's cattle. Whether, by extension, she could be responsible for the spread of the black sickness in Clement's Hollow – the agent of the Curse. Hurriedly, they thank Rel-se and make their departures. After discussion en route to town, they decide to split up. Eli will monitor Jessie's surgery while the others go to [[Magnolia 'Old Mags' Aurix|Old Mags]] at the Town Hall to inform her of their suspicions.


> *There's a whisper in the darkening skies. The gas-lamps of Clement's Hollow pulse in the night, like the gentle beating of a silent heart – struggling against the encroaching twilight.*

> *The faintest light spills from the edges of the drawn curtains of Doctor Jessie Lawrence's surgery. The front door trembles in its hinges in the evening breeze, swinging open and untended. From above, you feel the cold, remorseful touch of light raindrops weeping from unseen clouds above.*


Eli finds the door to Jessie's surgery ajar. He waits in the shadows for the return of the others, watching. In the Town Hall, the rest of the group find Old Mags brooding over a pictogram of [['Aunt' Elsie-May|Elsie-May]] – [[Holden Smith]]'s deceased Aunt. They tell her of their suspicions of Jessie and she agrees to accompany them to the surgery. Wild Bill, Sel and Amotti stay behind to check on [[Ignatius 'Nate' Barnett|Ignatius]] and [[Thomias Blake|Thomias]] in the holding cells. Though the door is locked (with Wild Bill later finding the key), Sel uses Misty Step to enter first. Inside, he finds Ignatius seemingly asleep and Thomias pacing the floor. He relays his suspicions about Jessie, and Thomias expresses disbelief. Ignatius, only feigning sleep, reiterates that he took Evangeline away from Jessie after her first assessment.

*"Jessie seemed more interested in Evangeline's condition than Evangeline herself."*

Leaving the Town Hall, the Players and Mags regroup with Eli. They climb the steps to Jessie's porch.

> *As you ascend the porch stairs, you notice a dark shape to your left. It moves with an almost imperceptible rise and fall – the throes of a life being snuffed out. Moving closer, you see that it's Alvina, the Lenity wildcat. She lies with her eyes staring vacantly ahead of her and her mouth retracted around her teeth. Beside her head, upturned and dripping through the slats in the porch floor, is a shallow bowl of pale white milk.*

The group desperately try to revive [[Alvina]], who is visibly on the edge of death. Mags tastes some of the milk with the tip of her finger before angrily spitting it out – it's been poisoned. Lythara then takes a sample of the poisoned milk. Thinking quickly, the group remember the healing properties of the Lenitium florana and crush up the flower given to them by Rel-se before forcing some into Alvina's open mouth. Almost immediately, the Lenity wildcat coughs up some foul liquid and rises, jumping from the porch into the shadows across the street. There she perches, hackles raised, and growls. The group make their way inside Jessie's surgery.

> *Moving through the door, the room beyond is lit by the flicker of a small candle burning next to an earthenware teapot on the shin-high coffee table. The door leading to the treatment room at the opposite end of the room is slightly ajar, with a dim light grasping at the edges of the frame.*

> *In front of it, lies an unmoving body. Face down and sprawled, hand outstretched toward the door as if grasping for the light beyond. From the dark leather duster, braided blond hair and forest-green skin, you can tell that it's Holden Smith – the young night watchman. Beside his outstretched hand is a smashed clay teacup, the remaining liquid and shrivelled leaves spilled onto the wooden floor beneath it. His eyes are open, glassy and unmoving, and a foul yellow residue pools at the edges of his mouth.*

Mags curses and is distraught beside Holden's body. The Players, having had success with Alvina, quickly grab some more flowers from the vase on her escritoire and force some into Holden's mouth. He regains breath, barely, and appears to stabilise though still unconscious. Finally, the Players have only one path ahead of them. They enter Jessie's treatment room.

> *Rain patters softly against the thin, glass pane of the rear window to Jessie's treatment room. The treatment table is unoccupied. In the simple wooden chair at the desk, Jessie sits staring into the middle-distance – vacant and sorrowful. Her left arm lies facing upward on her lap. Shattered on the floor at her feet lies a glass syringe with copper needle. From the jagged edges where the glass has broken, a shimmering fluid drips – a swirl of lilac and black. On the desk, a glass mason jar of the same fluid lies on its side – spilling its contents onto the scattered drawings and notes beneath it.*

Jessie doesn't look up as you enter, but instead feebly raises her right hand, clutched in which you can see a single lilac flower of the Lenitium florana.

*"I knew you would come for me, eventually. I've let things go too far, haven’t I? I think I see that now. I was so close to curing it, you know. I just needed a little more time. The right formula."*

Jessie looks forlornly out of the window and begins to tell her story to the Players.

*"They brought her to me first, Evangeline. It was raining that night, just like it is now. So beautiful, the sound. So terrible. When Nate lay her on my surgery table I knew the end had come. The sickness that was in her, pouring out of her, it would take us all if I didn’t stop it.*

*I think Ignatius could see what I was thinking somehow, or at least sense it. He took her away from me, but not before I took this."*

She raises a vial of the inky black liquid in her hand and looks at it pensively.

*"You must understand, I did it with the best intentions. I knew this was the key, the flower, I was sure of it. Right here on our doorstep. I read that it could slow metabolic mutation. I thought that if I combine it with small amounts of the black fluid, I could create a kind of vaccine – use the source of the disease to cure it. I could save us.*

*I started with the rabbits in the woods. Dosing them with small amounts of my solutions. Of course, I destroyed the ones I tested, I took every scientific precaution. Until one got out.*

*I looked for it everywhere, I swear I did. But one of Whip's hounds got to it first. I monitored them to start with, but the signs were there. I snuck into the kennels to try and put them down in the night but the one that had eaten the rabbit was already too dangerous, and had infected the others. So I let them out. Tried to get them away from the town.*

*I should have said something then. Given myself over to you Mags and... oh Holden. Such a sweet boy, how could I tell him what I'd done? But I let it out, didn’t I? I let it out into the woods and the town."*

Mags begins to growl as Jessie continues.

*"I didn't want to risk the hounds trying to get back into the town or the Marismentan camp to feed, so I snuck up to Slim Ed's and let some of his cattle out – hoping it would satiate them until I could figure out what to do.*

*But my time was already up. It was out. I knew I had to move my testing to the next stage. It was now or never. And then you showed up at my door with Tom, he was on the very edge of death. I administered him with my formula. I saved him.*

*All I had to do was keep an eye on Tom, see how he progressed, and then I could give my vaccine to everyone. Save the town. I was so close. And then Holden and Alvina came to my door, as they have so many nights.*

*But tonight was different. He'd spoken with Issy, and she'd seen me sneaking out. She knew Holden and I were sleeping together, and she'd warned him. He only came by asking where I had snuck off to but I could see his eyes. He looked at me like, like he was so scared. It broke my heart, but I couldn't let them stop me. You see that, don't you?"*

Jessie looks down sadly at the needle in her arm.

*"It's too late for me now anyway. I had one last chance, but I guess my vaccine wasn't ready. Whatever happens next, know I did it with the best intentions..."*

Jessie begins to convulse. Gently at first, and then violently. From her eyes, black tears begin to drip.

*"Tell everyone... I'm sorry..."*

Her head jolts back and her body goes rigid, as if taken by a spasm or fit. Her features begin to distort, limbs expanding and extending – clothes ripping at the seams. In clumps, her red and white hair begins to fall from her head. In its place, two monstrous horns of writhing black grow from her head. She stands, and casts the chair behind her. Clutching her head in pain, her body now wriggling and squirming with black tendrils as it continues to grow, she bursts out of the back wall of the surgery.

Careening off of the nearby buildings, Jessie stops in the main street. Standing to full height, in her tortured form she resembles a grotesque minotaur pulsing with the black fluid. She lifts her head to the gentle fallen rain, as if feeling it on her face. For a single moment, her head turns to the Players and there is a flicker of sadness in her large, round eyes. They cloud over with black malice and she screams to the sky - in pain and in rage...
