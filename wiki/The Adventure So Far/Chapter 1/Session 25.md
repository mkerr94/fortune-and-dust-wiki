# The Events of Session 25

The Players make their way out of the Ironworks after leaving the reunited [[Ignatius 'Nate' Barnett|Ignatius]] and [[Evangeline Barnett]]. [[Amotti]] expresses his concern that Ignatius remains a danger and has yet to fully answer for his part in the terrible events of the last few days. He questions whether justice has truly been served, and if the Players have the responsibility to do so. The others argue that the best course of action would be to leave well enough alone, ending with a final thought posed by Gambit.

>*“It’s the actions of a person which are good or bad, not the person themselves.”*

Leaving the Ironworks, the group decide to head back to the [[Clayborn Inn]]. On the way, they spot [[Alvina]] emerging from a darkened side street. The Lenity wildcat makes her way hastily across the Main Street in the direction of [[Doc Lawrence's Surgery]]. Following her, the Players catch sight of the body of [[Jessie 'Doc' Lawrence|Jessie Lawrence]], lying in the mud and pooling rain outside of [[Tryst's General Store]] where she fell. [[Lythara Sunstrider|Lythara]] sees that the [[Arthur and Neall Carpenter|Carpenter brothers]] are nearby, checking in on townsfolk door-to-door, and asks that they take Jessie’s body to the Town Hall.

Re-entering Jessie’s surgery, the Players find Alvina nuzzling next to an unconscious but still breathing [[Holden Smith|Holden]]. [[Gambit]] revives the young night watchman using Cure Wounds, and he jolts back to the waking world. Holden asks the Players what has happened, and Lythara tells him of the deaths of Jessie and [[Magnolia 'Old Mags' Aurix|Old Mags]]. This provokes Holden to despair and he wretches from the shock. He recounts to the group how Issy had said something strange to him regarding Jessie.

> *“Be careful of that one, Holdie. Sneaking out at all times of the night. Don’t go getting your heart broken.”*

In response, Holden had only gone to ask Jessie what Issy meant by this, unwittingly provoking her to poison him and Alvina in her panic at being discovered. [[Caeldrid Àrmann an Gealach|Caeldrid]] escorts Holden to the Town Hall, where he breaks down and begins to grieve over the bodies of his lover and surrogate mother. Left to his own devices in the surgery, Amotti begins to search through Jessie’s belongings. He finds a Potion of Greater Healing, and a mysterious green potion later identified to be a Potion of Cure Disease.

Meanwhile, [[Sel]] ventures alone back to the [[The Barnett-Blake Ironworks|Barnett-Blake Ironworks]] to ask a final favour of Ignatius. He finds Ignatius and Evangeline still in their embrace, and apologises for the urgency of his request. He asks Ignatius about [[Fortuna Outpost]], and how best to get there. Nate informs him that the best way is to follow a path West that leads out of [[Lenity Woods]], and then through dustland beyond - but that the group will need horses. Sel asks if Ignatius can arrange this, and he agrees to talk to [[Thomias Blake|Thomias]] on their behalf in the morning.

The group eventually reunite and return to the Clayborn Inn, with Sel heading straight to his room under the cloak of an Invisibility spell. The Clayborns are seated in the bar, with [[Slim Ed]] asleep next to them. [[Wild Bill]] and Gambit join them for a drink to debrief after the night’s events and they play cards once more. Wild Bill wins, and is rewarded with a modification to one of his pistols by Gambit. Caeldrid hesitates at the threshold to the bar, wondering if he should enter to say his farewells and express his feelings to [[Hattie Clayborn|Hattie]], but eventually decides against this and ascends to his room - leaving his unsaid words to settle in the air. One by one, the group fall asleep.

They wake in the morning, and Amotti notes that this is the first night that no one has experienced strange nightmares. He wonders if this may be linked to their banishing of the dark entity. In the bar, they meet Hattie who has prepared a light breakfast for them. She informs them that Thomias has called a town meeting and that she and her family will soon leave to attend. The Players decide to also go to the meeting, but first head to Tryst’s General Store.

Inside, they find [[Clarence Tryst|Clarence]] packing up and in a brighter mood than their previous encounters. He forces items into a large trunk and informs the group that he intends to sell up and go travelling, to see the rest of the world before he gets too old. After some haggling, Gambit purchases a fine, feathered hat for Ralf and a small, steel hand mirror for himself. Lythara buys a Potion of Minor Healing. Leaving the store, the Players attend the town meeting.

In the Town Hall, they see that Thomias Blake stands alone on the podium - looking nervous at the prospect of taking charge but steadfast in his responsibility.

> *“All right everyone, take your seats let's have some order. These are dark times, and we've all suffered – but we WILL get through it. I have called everyone together today with one simple task – rebuild. This is our town, yours and mine, and it will endure ONLY if we work together to save it.”*

Gram stands from the benches to interject.

> *“No disrespect, Thomias, but on whose authority are you taking charge here? Mags is dead and he (Gram points to Ignatius) has his fair share of blame for what's happened to us. How can we even trust that he won't explode again?"*

From the back of the room, Holden begins to speak. He is visibly hardened and his eyes have darkened. He speaks in a hushed but authoritative tone.

> *"Sit down Gram, and let him talk. Unless you have a plan to get us out of this. Thomias helped build this town, in case you've forgotten – we owe him our home."*

Thomias breathes a sigh of relief.

> *“Thank you, Holden. As you all will see, our dear Evangeline is on the mend – Ignatius Barnett has answered for his part in this and will step back from ALL his former responsibilities. As we will come to in time.*
>
> *Our first order of business, however, is our terrible losses. Mags, and Jessie. Jessie Lawrence we will discuss later, her mistakes are many but I hope that you all remember that many of you owe your lives to her healing work. She is to be buried among the lilac flowers by the lake. As for Mags, she kept us all safe. She'll be buried behind the Town Hall. Any objections? (There is a murmur of approval).*
>
> *Second order of business. Our saviours. These strangers to our town not only saved me, they've saved all of us. We owe them our gratitude and I encourage all of you to assist them in any way you can while they stay with us.”*

At this point, Amotti stands and asks if he may speak, to which Thomias agrees. Sel, worried he might say something to undermine the group, casts Suggestion on him.

> *“Hold your tongue, Amotti, until this meeting’s end.”*

This backfires, and causes Amotti to literally hold his tongue during his speech - making something of a mockery of the meeting to Thomias’ annoyance. However, Amotti finishes, and retakes his seat before any lasting damage is done. Wild Bill stands and apologises for this interlude and Thomias continues.

> *“Lastly, the assignment of new roles. We've lost some of the best of us, but we have those who are ready to step forward.*
> 
> *I will take charge of all Ironworks operations, and shifts will begin again day after tomorrow. All in favour? (There is agreement from the crowd).*
> 
> *Our new stablemaster, will be young [[Jebediah ‘Jeb’ Clayborn|Jebediah Clayborn]], who has also been returned to us. The lad won't let us down. All in favour? (Again, no objections).*
> 
> *Our new town doctor. I know this is so much to ask of you but you, [[Gram, Pernille and Clara|Pernille]]? I know you'll do what you can for us. All in favour? (A general approval).*
> 
> *And finally, our new law master. Holden, son, you and Alvina have looked after our streets these past few years with courage and dignity. You're ready, Mags knew it and I know it. All in favour? (The crowd turn gratefully to Holden and he is moved by the show of confidence).*
> 
> *Your first task Holden: I want you to organise a search party to look for Issy. She wasn't at her home this morning and hasn't been seen since last night.*
> 
> *Any other business?”*

Hattie Clayborn stands.

> *"The rain, Thomias. It's the first true downpour we've had in months. It might see us through for a while, the latest crop I mean, but not for long. We need food from the city. How are we going to get it without Whip?"*

Thomias shares a concerned look with Hattie.

> *“Thank you Hattie. I’ll remind everyone that our contract with the Vanderbilt Rail Co. still stands and it WILL bear fruit. We can use the proceeds to buy the food we need. In the meantime we'll all have to make do, and I'll try to talk to Rel-se about making the most of this latest rainfall.”*

Clarence Tryst offers his support.

> *"I'll supply what I can to help with the rebuild, Tom. Then I’m selling up, the town can have everything. Too old for the game now, is Clarence, I'm going to pack up and go travelling – see what's been left of this world.”*

Thomias delivers his final address.

> *“Thank you, old friend. You'll be sorely missed. That's all for now, please return to your homes and hold those dear to-“*

Thomias’ last word is cut off. The doors of the Town Hall swing open. The Players turn to see a solitary figure standing in the threshold, panting with exhaustion. It’s a young man, with a light beard and rough brown hair. He wears soldiers leathers, tinged with gold at the seams and adorned in the centre with a proud symbol: an unsheathed sword, pointing downward, with a watchful eye set at its hilt. He is covered in blood. In his shaking right hand, he holds a blood-stained piece of paper. Staring at the crowd, he falls to one knee. Sadness and fear in his eyes, he chokes out one last phrase before falling face first onto the floor of the Town Hall.

> *“She… sees us…”*
