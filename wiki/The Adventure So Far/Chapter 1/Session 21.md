# The Events of Session 21

Boarding two boats at the shore of the Lakeside camp, piloted by two Marismente, the players make their way out onto [[Lake Lenity]] in the direction of the singing. They find [[Rel-se]] and a group of her followers engaged in a strange ritual on the water. While Rel-se and a few others sing, some [[Marismente]] perform a rhythmic dance under the surface of the Lake. They are surrounded by tiny, flickering lights of electric green.

Waiting for the ceremony to come to its end, the group then question Rel-se about her and the camp’s knowledge regarding the Marismentan militia group, [[Eva Vanderbilt]] and the [[Shrine of the Forest]]. Rel-se doesn’t seem to recognise the photograph of Eva in the [[Vanderbilt Contract]], nor be able to elaborate on the potential whereabouts of the rogue group. When the group describe their finding of [[Jebediah ‘Jeb’ Clayborn|Jeb]] in the Shrine of Forest, Rel-se becomes perplexed and soon descends into deep thought. She asks the group to show her what they have found. Before leaving, she reveals to them that the tiny green lights under the water belong to Lenity catfish spawnlings, and that the dancing Marismente are encouraging these newborns out into the lake. She smiles knowingly, attempting to indicate to the players that, while the passing of the [[Lord of the Lake]] is worthy of lament, it is simply part of a much larger cycle of growth and rebirth - and should be celebrated as such.

Returning to shore, Rel-se, [[Gur-ak and Sut-ak]] accompany the players to the Shrine of Forest. [[Wild Bill]], [[Elias Blackwood|Eli]], [[Lythara Sunstrider|Lythara]] and [[Caeldrid Àrmann an Gealach|Caeldrid]] once again use their sea-glass beads to open the entrance - to the amazement of the Marismente. Rel-se and her guards inspect the stone pillars, and descend into the Shrine with reverence and wonder. It becomes clear that, although this place seems to be of great spiritual significance to them, they are amazed to see it in this form. The players confirm that Rel-se and her group had no knowledge of Jeb’s rescue or that he was residing in the Shrine. Solemnly thanking the players for what they have shown her, Rel-se and her guards retreat to the camp to take counsel on what they have seen.

Planning their next move, the group decides to head to the [[The Barnett-Blake Ironworks|Barnett-Blake Ironworks]] to further investigate the leg they retrieved from [[The Furnace Spider]], before making their dinner date with the Clayborns.  They break open the brittle material surrounding the leg using the table and hammer in the De-Casting Room of the Ironworks, and discover a strange sword housed within.

> *“The handle is covered in dark grey, bony, ridged material like hardened skin and ends in a deep black orb clutched by metallic spider legs at the hilt. The blade itself is long and thin, and glints with an icy blue. Its wicked sharpness seems to cut even the air it moves through. At the base of the blade, in spiky lettering is engraved the word “Hollowsteel”.*

Caeldrid decides to take custody of the sword until it is otherwise claimed. Meanwhile, [[Gambit]] identifies the magical ring ([[Garnet-inlayed Ring]]) found by [[Sel]] in the Ironworks Library as a Ring of Fire Protection. Checking in on Gwynevere and Ralph, Gambit finds them still guarding the relatively idle black fluid surrounding [[Evangeline Barnett]]’s door. He retrieves some items from a compartment in Ralph’s torso.

Finally, the players decide to return to the [[Clayborn Inn]] and join their hosts for dinner. Before they do, Caeldrid gathers some wild flowers outside the Western Gate for [[Hattie Clayborn|Hattie]], and Gambit enchants them to smell like roses.

> *“As the sun sets and the gas-lamps of Clement's Hollow ignite, the air becomes slightly colder. Gentle at first, and then steady, mournful, you feel a light mist of rain falling from the darkening sky. It falls on the rooftops of the homes around you in a whisper and moistens the packed-earth streets beneath your feet.*

The foyer of the Clayborn Inn is warmly lit by a lamp resting on the reception desk. You can hear muffled voices from the bar beyond the open doorway at the back of the room. Inside, Hattie and [[Jebediah ‘Jeb’ Clayborn|Jeb]] sit chattering at a set of two tables pushed together – set for all of you with cutlery and shallow bowls. Two baskets of fresh cut bread sit in the centre of each table.”

Hattie thanks Caeldrid warmly for the flowers, pours the group some wine and proposes a toast to their successful finding of Jeb and his safe homecoming. [[Sam Clayborn|Sam]] soon joins from the kitchen carrying a large pot of hearty rabbit stew, lovingly prepared and delicious. He thanks the party sincerely for returning Jeb to the Inn and Jeb’s ambitions on the stable master role in [[Clement's Hollow]] are briefly discussed. Hattie then steers the conversation toward the party’s confrontation with [[Ignatius 'Nate' Barnett|Ignatius Barnett]]. Caeldrid explains that the group believe Nate to have calmed, and that he is showing remorse for his actions. He also relays Nate’s warning that the true catalyst of behind the terrible events in Clement’s Hollow has yet to be found.

The dinner is then disturbed by a noise from the entrance of the Inn.

> *“Suddenly, you hear a rumbling noise from the front door of the Inn. The structure seems to shake as the sound of footsteps approach. From the bar door, stooping to enter, you see a creature emerge unlike any other you've yet encountered. It walks on two stout legs, its arms so long that they reach the floor, hands curved backward to stop from dragging. By rights it seems like this being should be walking on all fours. From head to toe, the monstrous figure is covered in hard seaweed-green scales. It doesn't appear to have a discernible neck, only a relatively square head occupied by two small eyes of crystal blue under ridged-brows and a wide mouth through which you can see two rows of short, razor-sharp teeth. All in all, the creature appears to be around 10 ft tall and of such bulk that its limbs and body appear to bulge. Bizarrely, it wears a Stetson hat, round glasses resting on a stumpy ridged nose, a waistcoat and a bolo tie.”*

Initially put on their guard by this unexpected arrival, the players are bemused when Sam, Hattie and Jeb greet the strange intruder as a friend.

*“Edward Kyler as I live and breathe, you old toad, my brother here’s been worried sick about you!”*

The figure is revealed to be none other than [[Slim Ed]] (full name Edward Kyler), the cattle rancher whose ‘girl’ the players found mauled by the [[Mutant Hounds]] on their fateful arrival in town. Lythara identifies Ed as a nergaliid - although he seems puzzled by the confusion.

*“Forgive me, but we haven’t seen  anyone of your kind since we arrived here.”*

*“Uh, you mean, cattle ranchers?”*

Ed explains that he came to the Inn after being informed by [[Holden Smith|Holden]] that Jeb had returned home, him being very fond of Jeb as the stable hand on his ranch. Hattie asks Ed how things are at the ranch, and he becomes troubled.

*"Four nights before last I heard my girls calling from their shed. I knew something wasn’t right from the sound of their voices, so I gets up to go for a look see. Son-of-a-devil must’ve heard me coming because he was gone already. What's more, the shed was busted open and two of my poor girls was missing. Here, I’ll show you."*

Ed reveals to the group a chain and padlock that he says was on his cow shed. It has been clipped neatly by mechanical means.

*"Now I get my fair share of opportunistic predators, from the woods or the lake and what have you, but look at that. This was done by man, make no mistake, unless them lake-lizards have learned to use wire-cutters and if that's so, then it's game over as for all of us. Some roaming poacher maybe, or a no good town-dweller down on their luck and looking to steal. All of the milk and leather I’ve given to the Hollow too, ain’t no shame."*

Jeb expresses shock that Ed thinks someone from the town may be responsible for the break-in, and Ed reveals one final mystery.

*"Well there is one other thing, my boy. It’s the damndest of all... I just can't figure it out. Whoever it was done broke into my ranch and let my girls out, he left this. The thread is snapped, see. Must’ve snagged it on the bottom latch of the gate when I startled ‘em. I ain’t never seen something like that in all my years."*

Ed extends a clasped hand to the players, and unfurls his fingers to reveal a cloudy blue sea-glass bead on a snapped leather necklace. It is identical to the ones given to the players by Rel-se and Lakeside Marismente as thanks for defeating the [[Mutant Lake-Lizards]]. The players ruminate on what this may mean.

The party eventually comes to the conclusion that whoever broke into Ed’s ranch and released his cattle must have had a close relationship with the Marismente. They must have done something for the camp worthy of the thanks of a beaded necklace. Questions racing in their minds, the party resolve to leave and visit Rel-se once more, hoping to finally find the answers to the mysteries of Clement’s Hollow.
