# Prior to the Outset of the Story
The players learn that they have each come under the employ of [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]], bound by their acceptance of the [[Vanderbilt Contract]] to help in the safe retrieval of his niece [[Eva Vanderbilt]]. Travelling together onboard the Flor de Mayo, bound from [[Waterdeep]] to [[Portumluna]], they are informed by an emissary of Vanderbilt that Eva has been kidnapped by [[Marismente|Marismentan]] militia.

After an allowance of three days in [[Portumluna]] to gather supplies and prepare for their task, they are to travel to the town of [[Clement's Hollow]] by way of a carriage that has been arranged for them. Clement's Hollow, it's explained, is the site of the most recent sighting of a group of Marismentan militia – who may have information on Eva's whereabouts.


# The Events of Session One

The Players travel by carriage, being driven by a coachman called [[Whip]], on the outskirts of [[Clement's Hollow]]. Upon looking outside, they see for the first time the Lenity lake-fog and the bare landscape that forms the route between the town and [[Portumluna]]. In the middle-distance, they see the edge of [[Lenity Woods]] and an amber glow that they assume to be Clement's Hollow itself. While the Players themselves are inside the carriage, [[Wild Bill]]'s horse 'Rusty Jack' trots along outside.

They are joined by [[Thomias Blake]], an ageing halfling, who converses with the Players after being roused from his sleep. As he converses with each Player Character, they in turn give a brief physical description of themselves. The Player Characters are revealed as: [[Elias Blackwood]] (Eli) (male human); [[Amotti]] (male drow); [[Gambit]] (male gnome); [[Wild Bill]] (male human); [[Sel]] (male tortle); [[Lythara Sunstrider]] (female high-elf); and [[public/Fortune & Dust/People & Organisations/Player Characters/Caeldrid Àrmann an Gealach|Caeldrid Àrmann an Gealach]] (male human). During their conversations, [[Sel]] at one point speaks in Undercommon.

From Thomias, the players learn several things.

Firstly, they learn about the town of Clement's Hollow. A small settlement of colonists and [[Marismente]] (whom Thomias refers to as 'Quagers') built on the shores of [[Lake Lenity]] and home to [[The Barnett-Blake Ironworks]]. They learn that Thomias is a co-founder of the Ironworks, and that he and Whip make frequent trips to Portumluna for business dealings with the [[Vanderbilt Railway Company]].

Second, the Players glean from Thomias that Clement's Hollow has fallen on tough times, and that the talk of the tabloids in Portumluna is that the town is 'cursed' after a number of strange incidents and disappearances. Sceptical, Thomias talks with great pride about the town and believes the 'curse' distracts from the real issues at play: failing agriculture and uncertain economic future.

Lastly, the players question Thomias briefly on the recent sighting of Marismentan militia nearby. Thomias doesn't seem too surprised by these enquiries, wryly surmising that such an unusual group are likely hired mercenaries. He reveals that members of [[The Protectorate]] warned the Ironworks of potential Marismentan attack a few days prior to the Players arrival – largely dismissed due to mild distrust of the 'Tecs' by the townsfolk.

Eventually, the carriage is pulled to a halt by Whip, citing that something is blocking the road ahead - "another one of [[Slim Ed]]'s girls maybe". Sel, curious and wary of the delay, exits the cart and discovers the blockage to be a horribly mutilated and predated upon cow. Sensing danger, he encourages caution and hurries Whip back to the carriage.

While discussing events with Thomias, Whip is pulled away by an unseen assailant. The players exit the cart to investigate, and find the horses (barring Rusty Jack) incapacitated. After further investigation, including scouting by Caeldrid with the help of his owl familiar Gwynevere, Gambit follows a trail of blood leading to Whip's body – which is being fed upon by a horribly mutated creature resembling a large dog with tentacles and a lamprey-like jaw.

Despite rearing and threatening to run off, Eli is able to calm Rusty Jack and bring him under control.

Two further creatures appear out of the darkness, and the party (including a shell-shocked Thomias) is drawn into its first combat in this strange new world against the [[Mutant Hounds]]. Displaying bravery and prowess, the Players deal with the threat deftly, using the roof of the carriage as a defensible position. During the fighting Thomias, Sel and Amotti reveal magical powers – with Sel seen at one point to briefly reverse time itself. In addition, Gambit reveals that he possesses a mechanical arm. [[Lythara Sunstrider|Lythara]] proves to be a deadly warrior with her glaive.

When the fighting is done, the party try to urge a shaken Thomias to press on toward the town as he mourns in disbelief over Whip's body. Lythara eventually comforts him to the point of being able to make his way forward, and the Players lift Whip's body onto Rusty Jack.

In a final twist of fate, the decaying corpse of the tentacled mutant hound grabs Thomias by the ankles and drags him toward its twitching jaws. The players look on in horror, and afterward pull the severely injured halfling from the creature and turn toward the town.

Now, pursued by distant howls, the Players carry Thomias and the remains of Whip toward the amber lamp-glow of Clement's Hollow. Seeking refuge. Seeking help.
