# The Events of Session 23


The Players and [[Magnolia 'Old Mags' Aurix|Old Mags]] do battle in the streets of [[Clement's Hollow]] with the mutated [[Jessie 'Doc' Lawrence|Jessie Lawrence]] ([[Jessie Lawrence (Mutated Form)]]), who is enraged and out of control. From her back, [[The Fragments|Fragments]] like the ones encountered by [[Caeldrid Àrmann an Gealach|Caeldrid]], [[Sel]] and [[Lythara Sunstrider|Lythara]] in the [[The Barnett-Blake Ironworks|Barnett-Blake Ironworks]] Living Quarters fall, multiply and begin to attack the group.

Caeldrid and Lythara try to cut through the monsters with their blades glowing with iridescent green moonlight and pulsing, purple psionic energy. [[Wild Bill]] and [[Gambit]] pepper Jessie from afar with their revolvers, with Bill ducking into the front porch of her surgery for cover. [[Amotti]] throws up his healing light, twin earrings alight with twilight magic. [[Elias Blackwood|Eli]] tries to pinpoint a weak spot on Jessie with his crossbow. Sel chooses his moments to manipulate the flow of time using his chronurgy and reverse potential catastrophe for his companions. All the while, Jessie slams the players with sweeping strikes of hideous black tendrils growing from her body and lashes at the group with deadly claws. Periodically, she emits a piercing scream which sends fear into the heart.

Old Mags throws herself into battle with the multiplying Fragments falling from Jessie. Slicing limbs from her foes only to find them re-growing, the proud but tiring dragonborn is eventually overwhelmed. One of the Fragments pounces on her chest in a moment of weakness and she falls, the insatiable monster ripping at her throat with its furiously snapping mandibles. With the old warrior downed and Jessie's attacks growing more and more aggressive, Gambit peels away from the melee and runs into the Ironworks looking for Ralf – who he eventually reaches and spins to return to the fray.

The group turn to fire to try to quell Jessie's rage. Lythara lights Jessie's mutated right arm on fire with a magical bolt, sending her reeling and screaming with an animal fear in her black, soulless eyes. She scales the roof of [[Tryst's General Store]] and begins lobbing pieces of debris at the players in a fit of uncontrollable desire to destroy. Seeing this, Caeldrid scales a gas-lamp and removes the orb from the top. He throws it to the roof of the General Store and it crashes at Jessie's feet. Flames begin to rise around her on the roof and lick at her sides, sending her into a frenzy. While distracted, a Fragment leaps onto Caeldrid's back and frantically scrambles to sink its fangs into his neck.

The session ends as the flames rise into the misty night and the party, bruised and bloody, steel themselves - resolving to end the monstrosity that Jessie Lawrence has become before she destroys the town she swore to heal whatever the cost...
