# Prologue

A hush falls over Clement's Hollow. In empty streets, untended lamps burn against the undulating mist. Behind drawn curtains, candles flicker. The town holds its breath, lest one small whisper blow out its fragile glow, raging against the edge of the night.

An old soldier speaks in hushed tones in a small house by the stables. A shopkeeper frets and rubs his hands. Two lovers entwine. A father weeps. A sister strengthens her resolve and a widow dreams of days gone by.

In a fortress of iron, a flame burns white hot and black dreams are dreamt. In a bottle-green lake, a fallen Lord receives water burial. In a shaded wood, an ancient power slumbers. And somewhere, out in the darkness, a humble farmer bolts his doors.

Out in the night, an unlikely party of three: a drow; a gnome; and a gunslinger, move through the streets. As they approach their destination, the hulking shadow of the Barnett-Blake Ironworks, a low growl is heard from their companion. Then, a bark. Finally, only the whisper of the fog through the grass…


# The Events of Session 12

Session 12 begins with [[Amotti]], [[Gambit]] and [[Wild Bill]] making their way from their meeting with [[Magnolia 'Old Mags' Aurix|Old Mags]] at the Town Hall to the front entrance of the [[The Barnett-Blake Ironworks|Barnett-Blake Ironworks]] ([[Barnett-Blake Ironworks Dungeon]]). After following Ralf, Gambit's mechanical dog, into the dark patch of ground between the two institutions, they find evidence that they were being watched by someone there. Investigating the area, Wild Bill spots a cloaked figure deftly climbing the nearby town wall. Incapacitating the spy before they can escape, the trio are surprised to find that it is an unfamiliar drow.

> *"They know you are here... you are all going to d-…"*

Before they can learn anything else, the figure’s eyes roll back in their head and their body appears to dissolve into a thousand tiny spiders which scuttle off into the night.

> *"Mistress... please..."*

Agreeing that nothing further can be done about their pursuer for now, with no trace of them left, the three enter the Barnett-Blake Ironworks through the now open main door – which closes behind them on entry.

Meanwhile, [[Lythara Sunstrider|Lythara]], [[Caeldrid Àrmann an Gealach|Caeldrid]] and [[Elias Blackwood|Eli]] attempt to break into the Ironworks living quarters after the Fire-Opal Door has closed behind [[Sel]]. They find the door itself impassable without the three Fire-Opals to serve as its key. Instead, they turn back to the Checkmate Door behind them and, after solving its peculiar opening mechanism, enter the Ironworks main hall on the 2nd floor to regroup with the rest of the party.

Sel awakes with a metallic taste in his mouth, finding himself bound to a chair in a small room. He spits black-flecked saliva onto the ground. After briefly looking at his surroundings and attempting to wriggle free, he hears a trap door open in front of him. Through it, steps [[Ignatius 'Nate' Barnett|Ignatius Barnett]].

> *"I do apologise for this, my friend. However, you must understand that I can't let you jeopardise my work, not when I'm so close. Besides, it seems that you may soon be in need of my help as well. Don't try to protest, I saw it when I found you on my office floor, in your eyes. It's in you too. I truly had hoped that it wouldn't come to this. Tell me, what possessed you to come here?"*

Aggressively rebuffing Ignatius' attempts at opening a dialogue, Sel tries to attack him from his seated position, but only succeeds in winding his captor.

> *Well, that wasn't very friendly now, was it? You're persistent, I'll say that much. Do you have any idea how reckless that little illusion stunt of yours could have been? In her current state, I believe my wife could destroy this entire town. Now that would be a cruel irony, no? After all we built this place, together. She must not be disturbed until I can cure her. I've already had to deal with that mageborn lodging with Clarence, trespassing like you – although I suspect your agendas are not aligned.*

Sel asks Ignatius to release him.

> *You know I can't do that, Sel. I’m afraid you now present far too great a practice opportunity to pass up, now that you are infected. Still, cold blood, I’m not sure how that will affect the technique - we will find out together soon enough.*

After further hostility from Sel, and realising that he will get no further conversation, Ignatius exits through the trapdoor, leaving Sel with some parting words.

> *I imagine the rest of your group will come for you sooner or later. Or will they? How well do you really know them? Would you trust any of them with your life? In any case, they can’t help me and they can’t help you. If you held any of them dear, then I am sorry, truly. I never meant for any of this. I'll be seeing you, Sel D'issan.*

With Ignatius gone, Sel eventually frees himself using his claws to cut the rope that binds him. After solving the puzzle of the room he is trapped in using a mirror, a shaft of moonlight and a gem set into the floor, he exits through the trapdoor into the room below - but not before casting a minor illusion broadcasting his location.

Outside, Lythara and Caeldrid are unable to find an alternative way through the Fire-Opal Door. Instead, they naturally use a combination of the four crowbars Lythara has on her person at all times and 100 ft of hempen rope to scale the roof of the Living Quarters. They find the roof bare save for the exterior of a raised attic room, which Caeldrid uses to anchor the rope and pull Lythara up. Again using the crowbars, Caeldrid finds a break in the sheet iron roof of the structure and pries it open. Looking through the gap he has created, he and Lythara see that it leads through to Ignatius’ Office…

Meanwhile, Wild Bill, Gambit, Amotti and Eli begin to explore the 1st and 2nd floors of the Ironworks Main Hall. They discover several things in the various rooms of the Main Building:

- In the Main Hall 1F, they find stairs leading to the basement (shrouded in darkness) and an iron door in the top right of the room that is glowing molten hot and impassable.

- In the Cooling Room 1F, they find a large, empty metal bath. Next to it is a cuboidal platform, on which rests a sledgehammer, surrounded by debris from broken casting moulds. Wild Bill and Eli try to use the sledgehammer to smash the chest they found in Ignatius’ shack and bypass the opening mechanism but find it protected. Later, they discover that a chess piece Amotti took from the shack fits perfectly into one of the indentations in its lid.

- They find a Casting Room with iron cauldrons on a pulley system that connects to the Cooling Room. In this room, there are several moulds. Amotti finds a mould that has a dinner-plate sized, circular indentation bearing the symbol of The Craftsman.

- In the Fuel Processing Room, Wild Bill and Eli use a conveyor belt to move logs and coal into the adjoining room blocked by the glowing door.

- On the 2nd floor, they find one door locked from the inside but that the two on the left hand side open to the 2nd floors of the Cooling and Casting Rooms.

Finally, in the Worker’s Room on the 2nd floor, the party find two mess tables. On one, sits a chess board…
