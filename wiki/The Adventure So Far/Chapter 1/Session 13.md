# The Events of Session 13

[[Wild Bill]], [[Elias Blackwood|Eli]], [[Amotti]] and [[Gambit]] deliberate over the chess set in the Worker’s Room of the [[The Barnett-Blake Ironworks|Barnett-Blake Ironworks]], and how it might be used to open [[Ignatius 'Nate' Barnett|Ignatius]]’ chest. They recall words that were written on the borders of the chess board in the [[Lake Lenity Fishing Shack]]:

> *Strong must be the head, to bear such a divine curse, heavy weighs the crown*
> *Blessed be my flock, those who would protect his grace, I will shepherd thee*
> *With fine steel and steed, we ride forth without falter, for strength and honour*
> *We eight march onward, in defence of our great lord, never to return*

Placing the necessary pieces in the corresponding slots on Ignatius’ chest, and correctly surmising that each line contained a 5-7-5 syllabic pattern forming the required numeric code, they open the chest. Inside is a glossy fire-opal of shifting red light, however they find the other two already missing.

Further exploring the Worker’s Room, the use a set of controls to begin water flow from an external tank, into an overhead aqueduct, and across the Main Hall into the Water Room. Realising that this same aqueduct has a divert which functions as a Furnace Room Emergency Overheat contingency, Wild Bill uses controls in the Main Hall to divert the flow - drenching and cooling the glowing Furnace Room door below.

Meanwhile, [[Lythara Sunstrider|Lythara]] and [[Caeldrid Àrmann an Gealach|Caeldrid]] drop into the Office of the Ironworks Living Quarters through the hole they created in the roof using Lythara’s OP crowbar. Inside, they find the office empty, but the door to the rest of the Living Quarters open. They pass through into a stylish Hallway - noting the adjoining doors and a statue which sits in a small recess at the end. They first explore the Bathroom, and find a marble tub filled with mysterious, murky liquid, but decide to explore elsewhere. They come across a large, circular door requiring a book-shaped stone tablet to open.

Assessing the remaining two Hallway doors, and deciding to leave one with an iron, diamond-shaped inlay (after remembering the danger [[Sel]] aroused by rapping on a similar door on the outside of the building), they instead turn their attention to the Lounge door. They find it locked by a simple keyhole, which they bypass by breaking open the door with Lythara’s trusty crowbar.

The room they discover beyond is a luxurious, if small, Lounge. It is furnished with a chaise-langue in front of a roaring fireplace - at the centre of which sits a book-shaped, stone tablet wreathed in the flame. They notice that the tablet seems to be protected behind a puzzle involving small statuettes on the mantlepiece. They instead try to chopstick the tablet out of the fire using two of Lythara’s crowbars. Failing in this, they extinguish the fire with water from their water skins - retrieving the Library Keystone. After retrieving the stone at great difficulty, they revisit the puzzle which protected it and solve it with relative ease.

Sel descends from his captivity in the Attic Room. He finds himself in a grand library, locked behind a sealed door at the end of a long corridor lined with bookshelves. Exploring his surroundings, he finds a small alcove. A jewellery box sits at the centre. Above it, Sel finds four books on a shelf, which he discovers to be fakes used to weigh down a series of switches. The titles read:

- *Pyromancy Through the Great Ages*
- *Northern Races of Faerun*
- *Ornithology of the Yuirwood*
- *Encyclopaedia of Alcadenan Fauna Vol III*

After deliberating for some time, Sel rearranges the books in the correct order so that, reading left to right across the first letter of each title, they spell O P E N, and the jewellery box is released. Inside, he finds a strange golden ring set with a fiery garnet which shimmers in the light of the room. It gives off a magic energy as he holds it aloft to study it.

Outside, Lythara and Caeldrid set the keystone into the Library door. It opens, and behind they find a bewildered Sel - holding a small golden ring aloft in one hand.

Wild Bill, Eli, Gambit and Amotti enter the Furnace Room. They find a large, spherical furnace with a scorch-marked glass window connected to a huge iron cauldron, and stairs leading to the 2nd floor above. The room is dark and silent. Suddenly, a globule of molten iron spits from the cauldron. It is followed by eight razor-sharp, serrated legs. Emerging from the cauldron, a giant spider, wreathed in shadow and flame and emitting sickening, mechanical clicks from its jaws confronts the group. Two smaller spiders, aflame and chittering with the metallic scraping of their jaws, descend from above.

The fight begins, the group peppering the Furnace Spider with blows but finding that any attacks they try to make directly without magical power are quickly swallowed in the flames surrounding its body. Gambit and Ralf incapacitate one of the Moltlings and it begins to malfunction and thrash wildly.

Wild Bill makes for the stairs to the 2nd floor and finds its gangways lined with barrels of coolant fluid. He tries to lift one but is unable to on his own, and cries out to his companions in the carnage below for help…
