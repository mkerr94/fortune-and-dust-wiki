# The Events of Session Two
The players begin Session 2 on the outskirts of [[Clement's Hollow]], in the aftermath of their defeat of the [[Mutant Hounds]].

[[Lythara Sunstrider|Lythara]] retrieves a severely injured [[Thomias Blake]] from the jaws of the dead tentacled hound. With [[Whip]]'s body already slung over Rusty Jack, and fresh howls piercing the still night air, the players decide to head swiftly for the town gates. En route, [[Amotti]] stabilises the ailing halfling and his previously ragged breathing slows. While semi-conscious, Thomias whispers the name "Evangeline...".

The players are met at the gates of [[Clement's Hollow]] by the young, half-orc night watchman [[Holden Smith]] and his Lenity wildcat companion, [[Alvina]]. Expressing shock and fear, he urges the players to follow him to [[Jessie 'Doc' Lawrence]]'s surgery – but not before being reminded to close the town gates.

Along the way to the surgery, the players get their first look at the town. Most of the homes and businesses they see are constructed of wood and iron, irregular in size and position. They make their way along the main street, and see the towering silhouette of the [[The Barnett-Blake Ironworks|Barnett-Blake Ironworks]] directly ahead of them – its various pipes and chimneys giving it the look of a huge metal spider at the centre of the town's web. Holden is briefly called out to by [[Issy]], an older dwarven woman sitting on her porch, who he instructs to "go on back inside Issy".

The players learn from Holden that strange events have befallen Clement's Hollow, and that he, Alvina and "[[Magnolia 'Old Mags' Aurix|Old Mags]]" are the only real defence the town has save for its wood and iron wall. Starting with the disappearance of a few animals (some dogs from Whip's kennels and some cattle from [[Slim Ed]]'s ranch), the situation has now deteriorated in that [[Marie Clayborn|Marie]] and [[Jeb Clayborn]] have gone missing – and now Whip and Thomias have been attacked. They also ask about the recent visit of members of the [[The Protectorate|Protectorate]] to the Barnett-Blake ironworks, about which Holden seems to know fairly little but surmises that they must have come from the nearby [[Fortuna Outpost]] to the west.

Reaching [[Doc Lawrence's Surgery]], Alvina stretches herself out on a bench outside while [[Sel]] investigates an open book nearby (Lakeside Herbs and Ointments Vol 3 by Albar Olson) in which he finds a circled drawing of a flower called Lenitium florana. The players maker their way inside and investigate the interior, finding various anatomical drawings and a small desk. They then meet Jessie Lawrence, the town doctor, who, after getting a brief rundown of the events leading to the players arrival, takes them through to her treatment room.

The treatment room has a surgical bench and various jars and bottles of what look like herbal salves. Jessie begins treating Thomias and asks the players to wait outside, urging Holden to stay. [[Elias Blackwood|Elias]] overhears Jessie agitatedly instructing Holden that "someone has to tell..." before being hushed by him. Holden then re-emerges and asks the players about where they intend to stay for the night – for which he recommends the [[Clayborn Inn]].

Upon arrival at the inn, [[Wild Bill]] hitches up Rusty Jack and Holden bids goodnight to the players to continue his watch. Before leaving, he warns the players to tread lightly with the inn-keep, Hattie, as her mother and brother have recently gone missing. He also suspects the players might find "Old Mags" drinking there. The players make their way inside and are greeted warmly by [[Hattie Clayborn]], the young human inn-keep. On her reception desk, they see a pictogram depicting the Clayborn family on the shores of [[Lake Lenity]]. From Hattie, the players rent rooms and breakfast at the inn. Lythara takes the master (honeymoon) suite, Sel and [[public/Fortune & Dust/People & Organisations/Player Characters/Caeldrid Àrmann an Gealach|Caeldrid]] share, and Elias, Wild Bill, [[Gambit]] and Amotti take the other room.

Hattie chats with the players briefly, but long enough that she is encouraged by the rare fresh faces to gossip about a strange 'mage-born' who has recently taken up residence in the vacant room above [[Tryst's General Store]]. Before encouraging them to take a night-cap in the bar, she warns them to be careful how they approach Magnolia "[[Magnolia 'Old Mags' Aurix|Old Mags]]" Aurix, the golden dragonborn Lawmaster who is drinking there – she has a temper and doesn't have much enthusiasm for new people. Caeldrid and Sel retire to their room for the night, which they find humbly decorated and fitted with a window overlooking the street below. They discuss their respective burgeoning attraction to Hattie and Jessie.

The rest of the players go through to the bar, where they are served by a winking Hattie with her red hair let down after ringing the service bell. Tensions rise between the players and Old Mags after her attention is caught by the mention of the attack and the fate of Thomias and Whip by Amotti. She bids the players to explain their presence here and inform her of what has befallen the coachman and his passenger, before being further agitated by an interruption from Gambit – who points out that she hasn't yet introduced herself. Elias, Lythara and Wild Bill attempt to diffuse the situation, and eventually Mags leaves – having gained enough information to presumably go and check on Thomias and Holden. Before leaving, she instructs Hattie to inform her if the players check out of the inn.

A nervous Hattie reassures the players that Mags will come around, and pours them a drink to decompress after a long and rough night. Tired, strained and uncertain of what's to come, the rest of the players ascend the stairs to their rooms to sleep.

Before going to bed, Amotti takes a small handful of dirt from outside and places it under his pillow.
