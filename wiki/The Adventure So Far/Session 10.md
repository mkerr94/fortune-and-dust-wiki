# The Events of Session 10
Session 10 begins with the players under attack from the [[Lord of the Lake]], having just fallen from the splintered hull of the Whisper on the Wind.

A struggle ensues in the water below and on several giant lily pads floating on the surface of lake as the players try to fend off the assaults of the enraged catfish. Amidst the chaos, [[Wild Bill]] is knocked unconscious while in the water, saved from drowning only by being heaved onto the surface of a lily pad by [[Elias Blackwood|Eli]]. [[Amotti]] and [[Lythara Sunstrider|Lythara]] also suffer multiple blows in their respective fights with the mutated lake-dwellers. The [[Lord of the Lake]], increasingly wounded and panicked, begins to rage and flail as its attacks become more and more desperate. It is finally dropped by two bolts from Eli's crossbow to the roof of its open mouth. At the point of death, the eyes of the creature soften and its pupils are briefly visible as it lets out a final mournful cry and begins to sink to the bottom of the murky water.

Without voicing his intentions, [[Sel]] slips into the water and pursues the carcass of the fallen giant. Forcing his way into its innards, he gropes in the dark for the source of its pain. Eventually, his hand grasps something firm, still pulsing in the belly of the dead creature. He feels something swiftly brush past his face and instinctively grabs it before all goes dark.

With Sel not having surfaced for several minutes, [[Caeldrid Àrmann an Gealach|Caeldrid]] dives into the water after him and catches up to the sinking body of the Lord of the Lake. He sees the surface of its skin being pushed from the inside and deftly slices open its gut with his blade, finding a flailing Sel - whose eyes have turned an opaque black. Caeldrid drags the unconscious tortle onto the nearest lily pad, and the rest of the players look on as he begins to spasm and convulse.

Sel awakes underwater, in a clear blue lake populated only by waving leaves of kelp. Looking down at his body, he sees that it is no longer that of a tortle but a humanoid of dark grey-blue mottled skin. Sensing motion ahead of him, he looks up to see a coalescence of black energy in the shape of a giant catfish speeding through the still water towards him. He attempts to cry out to it, and receives a response:

> _Sickness... pain... rage... I will devour... I will consume... everything..._

He can only close his eyes as its first impact strikes him, opening them again to see the entity turn for a second charge.

On the lily pad, [[Gambit]] telepathically calls out to Sel and attempts to bring him to consciousness. In the clear blue lake, Sel sees a sudden shaft of dappled sunlight pierce the surface and swims toward it frantically. Nearly breaching, he is pulled violently down by a black tendril extending from the creature below him. Meanwhile, Caeldrid pulls Sel's tortle body towards him and slaps him in desperation as his convulsions grow more violent and flecks of black liquid appear in the veins around his eyes.

Sel makes one final push toward the surface of the water and succeeds, bursting into consciousness in his tortle body and retching up a small puddle of black liquid. The liquid begins to ripple and move toward the edge of the lily pad, only to be halted by a swing from Caeldrid's sword - glowing in the moonlight. On impact, the substance dissipates into a shower of tiny particles, which fly off toward the now-visible glow of Clement's Hollow on the shore.

Looking around, the players see through the clearing lake-fog that they have finally reached the island on which the fishing shack sits. Using the remaining boats and one of the lily pads, they arrive on the shore. Eli investigates the shack, from which they can see a faint orange glow through a small window, but there appears to be no one present. Using the key he and Gambit stole from Issy, Amotti opens the door and Lythara steps inside.

The interior is furnished by a single bed, desk, bookcase and a cooking pot over a circular fire pit. Lythara notices that the floor in the centre of the shack has been cleared and is marked by scorching and soot-stains. However, her attention is immediately drawn to a pictogram hanging above the bed, which is unmade and recently slept in. The pictogram depicts a young Ignatius, [[Evangeline Barnett|Evangeline]] and [[Thomias Blake|Thomias]] embracing in smart dress beneath a banner which reads "Welcome Initiates". On the back is a scruffy handwritten note that says "Initiate's Ball, Founder's University, lighten up Nate!".

Sel enters the shack and investigates the bookcase, discovering that the source of the light is a strange glass object in the shape of a figure eight, around which a small orb of enchanted fire makes rhythmically-timed loops. He removes the object and surreptitiously hands it to Caeldrid and Gambit waiting on the shore, wrapped in his cloak. He also gives Caeldrid his stack of letters, expressing his worry that they may not be posted should he come to mortal harm, and his wish that Caeldrid would see this task complete should that happen. Using the leaves he stole from [[Issy]], Amotti begins to use lake-water and the cooking pot to make tea, but is unable to find a source of fire to light the pit – with Lythara telling him that she has no means of doing so either.

With Amotti leaving the shack in search of a source of flame, Lythara shrugs and lights her torch to investigate the desk under its fire-light. On it, she finds an open journal written in a neat, spiky script across regular lined pages and margins. Next to this, she sees a wooden chess board arranged with black and white marble pieces. The chess board has fine, engraved writing around its four edges and she notices that a black pawn has been placed at the opposite end of the board in white territory.

As Eli joins her, he and Lythara begin to read the pages of the open journal in front of them. It has dated entries, beginning just over three weeks before the players arrival in [[Clement's Hollow]] and ending the previous night. They flick through three entries in chronological order:

## Journal Contents
### First Entry
As suspected, focused and conscious manipulation of the reactive oxygen in the internal tissue of the subject _(a note is scribbled here - pyromancy corporis?)_ does seem to illicit physiological change _(another note - THE FIRE IN THE BLOOD)_. However, prolonged treatment caused puckering of the skin and visible boiling of bodily fluids. Subject deceased _(an underlined note - technique needs __REFINEMENT__)_

### Intermediate Entry
Subject with broken left forelimb was treated with rhythmic, focused waves of PC directed at the affected tissue. The limb appeared to reconstitute and regain function within first hour of treatment however tissue expansion proliferated beyond control and subject skin ruptured. Subject deceased. I have constructed a metronome of sorts from flame and glass to focus timings to an ideal meter. This will be trialled in future attempts _(a scribbled note reads - must be __BETTER__)_.

### Final Entry
Subject breathing irregular and heartbeat faint. Focused waves of PC in rhythm with metronome were directed at heart for two hours of sustained treatment. Heartrate increased to basal rate and breathing returned to normal. Subject regained consciousness 20 min after cessation of PC treatment. Survival at normal physiological function has been maintained now for 24 h. Unusual discoloration of eyes has developed, however no detriment to visual acuity has been observed. Experiment considered successful _(a final note reads – is she strong enough? Is it worth the risk?)_

While Eli and Lythara read, Sel also takes the pictogram from the shack and Amotti successfully begins to boil his tea after obtaining kindling from Caeldrid. Wild Bill investigates under the bed and finds an ornate, iron chest. The chest is inlaid with four small, circular indentations in a cross pattern (one at the top, two below it side by side, and one below) and a cylindrical clasp holds the seam shut. He and Lythara fail to open the chest by force, and the party decide to leave the shack with it.

Before leaving the islet, Wild Bill explores the area behind the fishing shack. He finds a humble grave surrounded by softly glowing Lenitium florana flowers, its headstone weathered and the engraving thereon faded beyond reading. He also finds a decayed fishing boat, with two rods (of a size too small for regular humanoids), and a wicker picnic basket. The basket was clearly once well-tended and cherished, but is now worn, empty and forlorn. Afterward, the party decide to depart and make their way back to Clement's Hollow.

Amotti pockets the black pawn from the chess board and takes a gulp of his freshly brewed tea to find that, while slightly bitter and containing particulates from the lake water, it is otherwise delicious and restorative after a long night in the cold embrace of the Lenity lake-fog.
