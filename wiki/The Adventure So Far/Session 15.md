# The Events of Session 15

Session 15 begins with [[Wild Bill]], still carrying an unconscious [[Elias Blackwood|Eli]], coming face-to-face with Red in the basement of the [[The Barnett-Blake Ironworks|Barnett-Blake Ironworks]]. [[Red]] asks that Wild Bill free him from the shackles binding him to the wall, and explains that he was caught and restrained by Ignatius. As a gesture of goodwill, he furnishes a healing potion for Eli from a pocket in his waistcoat.

Wild Bill frees Red from his restraints, and in turn the grateful mage-born reveals from his person and gifts to Bill the remaining fire-opal - the last of the three.

> *“Now, here is a pretty thing… From the looks of you, you've seen one before. Genasi in origin, I believe, of no great magical power beyond their beauty and value. However, if you have by any chance seen two more in your travels, you may be able to make our way through that confounded door upstairs. Let's try it together, shall we?”*

Red, Wild Bill and the now conscious Eli return to [[Gambit]] and [[Amotti]] at the top of the basement stairs. The party converse with Red and, although he asks for their discretion in return for his own, they learn a little more about his motivations and activities in [[Clement's Hollow]]. The group learn that Red is something of an expert in *“the magical, the mystical, and the macabre”*. He has come to [[Alcadeña]] and onward to Clement’s Hollow at the behest of an employer, who he declines to name. He was drawn to Clement’s Hollow by rumours of the curse, and he seeks an artefact which he now no longer believes to be in town.

Articulate, charming and self-effacing throughout their conversation, Red quickly gains the trust of the party. He magically revives the unconscious Gambit and, with the final fire-opal in hand, he suggests they make their way to the opal door together.

Wild Bill, Eli, Amotti, Gambit and Red finally open the fire-opal door - and move into the office beyond. They discover the hole in the roof and rope that [[Lythara Sunstrider|Lythara]] and [[Caeldrid Àrmann an Gealach|Caeldrid]] used to enter the Ironworks Living Quarters, which Red remarks upon.

> *“Now why didn’t I think of that?”*

In the hallway beyond the office, they reunite with Sel, Lythara and Caeldrid. Reconciling, the players then discuss their next move - whether to attempt to gain entry to the diamond-inlaid door or whether to escape the Ironworks.

Lythara, Caeldrid, Sel and Amotti each in turn attempt to damage the diamond door (now covered and protected by the strange black tendrils after their defeat of [[The Fragments]]). Lythara first tries to burn a small section with a torch, but finds the black tendrils knotted tighter and thicker where she lays the flame. Caeldrid attempts to throw his hand-axe at the door, which is caught by the strange substance and enveloped. Sel tries to burn the door with the intense flame of his dragon-head spell, and finds that the substance covering it lashes out in retaliation and secures its defences even further.

Finally, Amotti attempts to touch the door with the spider-leg casting mould he found in the Furnace Spider’s remains. While this fails to perturb the door’s defences in any way, it does prompt Gambit to attempt to magically identify the object. He finds that he can’t, however is struck by the sensation that something magical lies within.

With the party now resolved to try and escape the Ironworks, Sel moves back into the Main Hall and makes a last attempt to call out Ignatius using a Minor Illusion. He receives a response. [[Ignatius 'Nate' Barnett|Ignatius]] appears in the Main Hall below, and addresses the players in a voice that seems to reverberate around the whole of the Ironworks.

> *“I didn’t want any of this, you know. None of it. All my life, I’ve had to hide what I am. Now what I am is the only thing that can save Evangeline. I am so close, don’t you see? I want to save her, save this place that we’ve built! I won’t let you destroy that. No, I’m afraid, you’ve come far enough. You’ve chosen flame and ruin.”*

Behind the players, the fire-opals detach from the door and float down to Ignatius. They begin to swirl around him, faster and faster. He raises his hands and gazes at them longingly.

> *”Forgive me, my love. I’ll be with you soon.”*

On plumes of shimmering hot air, Nate and the opals begin to rise. Higher and higher, into the centre of the Main Hall. The opals begin to grow, rippling and losing their form as they expand. They drop to the ground and rise, transformed into molten golems ([[Fire-opal Golems]]) of flame and glass – faceless, newly born and screaming a hideous glassy scream. As they do, lidless glowing eyes form in their heads, forever staring.

As Nate ascends, he winces and grunts, and cracks begin to show in his skin. Searing bands of amber wrap their way round his hands, his torso, his head, in ancient patterns and lines long forgotten. His skin becomes deep black, glossy and gleaming like a seam of onyx crystal. He clenches his eyes shut. When they open, they are two flaming orbs without iris. He has transformed into [[Ignatius Barnett, Flame Vessel]].

Eli immediately begins the retreat. He secures his rope to the railing of the connecting bridge outside and descends to the ground below. He is followed by Wild Bill and Sel. All the while, the party are slowly but relentlessly pursued by Ignatius.

Hurling a fireball from his hands, Ignatius knocks out Gambit. He is picked up by Amotti and carried outside. In a desperate attempt to save his friend, Amotti casts Gambit’s limp body over the side of the railing to Wild Bill and Eli below - a 40 ft drop. 10 ft from the ground, he slows his momentum telekinetically, and Gambit falls toward the waiting arms of his companions…
