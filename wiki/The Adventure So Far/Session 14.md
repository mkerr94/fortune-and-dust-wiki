# The Events of Session 14

[[Wild Bill]], [[Elias Blackwood|Eli]], [[Gambit]] and [[Amotti]] are beset by [[The Furnace Spider]] and its [[Furnace Moltlings]]. Wild Bill and Eli combine their strength to hurl a barrel of the coolant liquid at the body of the spider. Its flame is extinguished briefly and it becomes vulnerable to the group's attacks, however is soon re-ignited. Eli manages to wound the creature by firing a crossbow bolt through a coolant barrel, dousing his bolt in cooling liquid and protecting it from the spider's flames, but his enemy responds by striking him with a wickedly-serrated forelimb and knocking him unconscious.

Gambit too, is incapacitated, leaving Wild Bill and Amotti to defeat the creature alone. Finally, with his clothes burning and hope looking thin, Wild Bill aims a true round from the chamber of Luck through a coolant barrel. The doused bullet strikes the spider between its mandibles – and a screaming outpouring of steam is heard as it's destroyed. Afterward, Wild Bill dubs himself *'The Flaming Gun.'* Amongst its remains, Wild Bill and Gambit find a second Fire Opal, as well as one of the spider's forelimbs. The forelimb seems to be made of casting mould material, and is encasing something inside which burns hot and cold and shines with a grey-blue light.

[[Lythara Sunstrider|Lythara]], [[Caeldrid Àrmann an Gealach|Caeldrid]] and [[Sel]] reunite. After Sel recounts his capture by [[Ignatius 'Nate' Barnett|Ignatius]] and subsequent escape, the three explore more of the Ironworks Living Quarters. Lythara's attention is caught by the statue set into the small recess at the end of the Hallway. The statue is made of white marble. It depicts a woman in white gown, shrouded over her head. Her blank marble eyes stare longingly at Lythara as she gazes up. About her shoulders, long strands of marble hair rest gently. She holds both hands across her chest, and the group sees that she is clutching something - a rectangular object, holding it dear to her.

At the statue's base, Lythara sees a small gold-plated plaque that reads *"The Warmth of a Lover's Touch"*.

Ignoring this clue and resolving to retrieve the item with her crowbar, Lythara attempts to remove the object by force. She fails, however Caeldrid succeeds in her place. Picking up the object and turning it round in her hands, the group reveal that it's a frame – wrapped in soft brown cloth. Unwrapping it, they find a pictogram inside showing a scene from the past... 

> The pictogram depicts a group of people standing in front of the main door of the [[The Barnett-Blake Ironworks|Barnett-Blake Ironworks]]. The crowd gather round a central couple, one of whom you recognise as Ignatius Barnett. He is tall and thin, dressed in smart suit and waistcoat -black hair swept back. He has one arm wrapped around a beautiful woman, slightly shorter and of dark skin and raven hair – she wears a white dress. Both figures look out of the frame with delight, smiling and eyes aglow.
> 
> In the crowd, you spot a laughing [[Thomias Blake]] standing just to Nate's right. Next to Thomias, you see an older orc woman of dark-green skin and lighter braided hair. She stands protectively over a younger, adolescent half-orc of the same green skin and light hair – perhaps 10 or 11 years old. Behind them, you see [[Magnolia 'Old Mags' Aurix]], stern and proud. She rests a gentle hand on the orc female's shoulder.
> 
> In his arms, the young half-orc holds an abnormally large kitten. He seems distracted as the kitten paws his face, instead staring in wide-eyed wonder at the figure standing a little apart to his left. You recognise the object of his attention as [[Jessie 'Doc' Lawrence|Jessie Lawrence]], the firbolg town doctor. Not appearing much younger than she does now, but just as beautiful, she seems undistracted by her admirer - instead poring intently over an open book in her right hand.
> 
> To the left of Ignatius' bride, you see [[Issy]] and [[Clarence Tryst|Clarence]] standing side by side. Issy has a vacant but happy look in her eyes. Clarence looks away from the camera and up with slight annoyance at the [[Arthur and Neall Carpenter|Carpenter brothers]] (Art and Neall) who are both laughing at some joke - frozen forever in time. To their side a clean-shaven [[Sam Clayborn]] stands next to a kind-faced lady of tumbling red hair. She warmly caresses an adolescent girl of flame-hair and boyish stubbornness, and a boy, younger and sheepish - who clings to her side.
>
> Around the crowd, the pictogram seems to sparkle as cascades of fluttering confetti fall around their heads. One perfect, precious moment – clutched tight, forever and unchanging.
> 
> On the reverse of the frame is a handwritten note in a smooth, flowing script. It reads:
> 
> “Best day of my life! I’m so proud of what we’ve built. Keep smiling, Nate. I love you, now and always! - Evangeline.”

Upon viewing the pictogram, Sel begins to convulse. Lythara and Caeldrid stare on in horror as he drops to one knee, eyes clouding over with opaque black, and begins to cough. His coughs bring up two strange lumps of wriggling black liquid – which he regurgitates onto the floor. Lythara and Caeldrid see that the puddles of liquid grow legs and tentacles - [[The Fragments]], and one jumps for Caeldrid's throat.

While Lythara and Caeldrid battle the Fragments in the Hallway, Sel experiences strange visions. In the first, he appears to be seeing through the eyes of Thomias Blake – sitting in his home and conversing with an increasingly worried Old Mags. Through Thomias' eyes, Sel learns of Mags' uncertainty over sending the party to the Ironworks to confront Nate – expressing that, as his oldest friend, she should've come straight to Thomias. Struggling at first, Sel manages to control Thomias voice. Through him, he urges Mags to get to the Ironworks, and to take Holden Smith with her. Mags hesitates at this, stating:

> *"You know how dear the boy is to me, Tom."*

Sel experiences Thomias begin to convulse and drop to the ground, and his vision fades as Mags stoops to aid the scruffy halfling.

His vision clearing again, Sel experiences a second vision. In it, he is in the body of a woman lying in bed. Recognising the bedroom from a previous vision, Sel surmises he is in the body of Evangeline Barnett.  Her thoughts pulse through her mind as waves of increasing urges.

> *"Rage. Unfathomable rage. Pain. Sadness. Longing. Hunger."*

The woman experiences pain in her abdomen. Looking down, Sel sees a swollen stomach and hears a rhythmic heartbeat in a cadence of two. Evangeline is pregnant. Sel forces her up to explore the room. He shakes a serving bell by her bed, which Lythara and Caeldrid hear coming from behind the diamond-inlaid door in the Hallway. Looking in the mirror, Sel is overcome with Evangeline's sorrow that her mind and body are contorted by her infection. She longs for Ignatius, a longing which turns to hunger.

Sel considers attempting to force Evangeline to commit suicide. However, before he can, a formless black figure - the [[Unknown Entity]], sneering and grinning sinisterly, appears before Evangeline's eyes. Evangeline recognises her tormentor, and Sel struggles with her spirit as he attempts to have her succumb to the creature - but her will holds true. In a moment of clarity, Evangeline forces herself to reach out and touch the entity, and the creature recoils from light that seems to spring from her fingers. With the entity repelled but Evangeline's energy spent, Sel's vision blurs again as he is released from her body.

He comes to in the Hallway, and aids Lythara and Caeldrid as the trio use all of the magical flame available to them to annihilate the strange Fragments that sprouted forth from Sel. The three witness the diamond-inlaid door being sealed behind the residual black liquid from the Fragments, and resolve to escape the Ironworks.

In the aftermath of the Furnace Spider encounter, Wild Bill and Amotti nurse the fallen Gambit and Eli, and place the second Fire Opal in the Opal Door. Using the reignited furnace and the last of the Ironworks machinery, they forge, cool and de-cast an iron disk bearing the Symbol of the Craftsman from the mould that Amotti found earlier in their explorations. Amotti ponders if they might use the same cooling and de-casting process on the forelimb left behind by the Furnace Spider.

Realising that their newly-forged disk must fit a door they haven't yet explored, they descend to the Basement. Finding an empty cavity which matches the object, they place it inside and open the Basement Door.

Stepping down into the darkness, they see light coming from a small hand-lamp. Behind a set of iron girders, they see a figure shackled to the wall. The figure raises his head and reveals himself as [[Red]], the strange mage-born lodging with Clarence at the General Store.

> *"Well, I did wonder how long it would be before you chaps turned up."*

Wild Bill smiles and retorts.

> *"Looks like Ignatius caught himself a little piggy..."*
