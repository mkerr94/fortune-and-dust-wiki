# The Events of Session 9
At the outset of Session 9, the party set out onto [[Lake Lenity]] on the Whisper of the Wind, the dimness of the early evening lit only by the crackling torches set in the prow and the eerie pulse of [[Amotti]]'s Dancing Lights. As [[Lythara Sunstrider|Lythara]] and [[Elias Blackwood|Eli]] row further and further out onto the murky water, the party quickly lose sight of shore.

Slowing to a halt to determine their course, [[Caeldrid Àrmann an Gealach|Caeldrid]] sends Gwynevere above the fog to scout. Through her eyes, he identifies an area of the lake-fog that appears to be thicker than the rest, and the party tentatively decide to head in its direction. Gwynevere, circling and circling through the fading evening light and swirling grey clouds, also glimpses a figure in a brief parting in the haze. The figure manifests as a beautiful, pale woman of flowing blonde hair. She wears a sheer white gown and seems to hover in the air, before vanishing as quickly as she appeared.

Entering the thick fog, which rhythmically flashes with iridescent green energy, the players begin to hear barely audible whispers – some secret song of the evening breeze across the surface of the lake. As their minds begin to wander to the the gentle ebb and flow of the water, some of the party begin to experience visions in the mist.

Eli sees the face of a young girl with seafoam eyes and blonde hair, her face seemingly suspended in motion and her hands pressed against an invisible barrier.

Lythara, moving to the prow of the Whisper, sees the malevolent face of a high elf, onyx-skinned and bursting with amaranthine energy. The figure grips her by the wrist for the blink of an eye and is gone.

[[Wild Bill]] finds himself alone in the boat, the lake silent around him. Scanning the horizon with Luck drawn, he is startled into loosing a shot by the apparition of a ghostly-white couple with raven hair – blood dripping from the corners of their mouths. The gunshot breaks his enchantment, and the startled party look on as the bullet flies out harmlessly into the fog.

Finally Amotti, seeking to light their way forward with greater intent, begins to send his lights out further and further into the thick fog. Seemingly beyond his control, one appears in a flash of scarlet red and illuminates the face of a female drow just beyond the light's reach – smiling wickedly and observing him with glowing ruby eyes. When the vision fades, Amotti's attention is grabbed by the hypnotic pulsing and undulating of the the green lights in the fog, now moving under the surface of the water as well. With the party looking on in disbelief, he calmly steps up onto the prow and falls overboard.

Lythara manages to reach down into the mossy green depths and heave an unwilling Amotti back onto the deck. Looking up, hoping to catch a glimpse of what entranced him, she instead sees a huge pair of bulbous green eyes, lidless and glowing, and a colossal black jaw lined with razor teeth speeding toward the boat.

The Whisper on the Wind is besieged by a leviathan catfish, rippling with green energy and enraged. In tow, three other smaller catfish begin to leap from the water and attempt to latch onto the players. One grips onto the head of Gambit, and the gnome manages to grapple the slippery, writhing body and cast it back into the deep.

With the Whisper beset and the fight seeming desperate, [[Sel]] summons his arcane strength and begins to levitate the boat above the water. For a moment, all seems quiet, before two of the smaller catfish begin to target not the party but to leap at the hull of the Whisper itself. To the horror of the players, the hull splinters and shatters under the force of their blows, and the party tumble to bottle-green lake below – now at the mercy of their attackers...
