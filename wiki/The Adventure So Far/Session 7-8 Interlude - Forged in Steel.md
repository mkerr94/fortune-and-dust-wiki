#chapter1 

*Nothing in this one either.*

Thin lines the colour of smouldering embers snaked around the coal-black skin on his arm, up his wrist and across his knuckles as he turned the page of the open book. Around his head, the dull grey glow of his Library mage-light bobbed in the air, shimmering in the dimness of the Main Hall, as if patiently waiting for him to continue.

*Grey? Very funny.*

Ignatius Barnett sighed, slumped in his chair and pressed a closed fist to his temple to rest his head.

> *“Anything, Nate?”*

Ignatius looked up to Thomias Blake. The scruffy halfling was thumbing through a book of his own from a ladder propped against one of the nearby bookcases. The mage-light hovering near his shoulder was a radiating yellow, illuminating the wall of books that rose and rose into the cavernous ceiling, like the others that lined both sides of the room and stretched into the darkness.

> *“Nothing that will do. Minor illusions and disguises. I take it you’ve had more luck?”*

Ignatius nodded to the warm light next to Thomias’ head.  Turning to observe it and squinting his eyes, Thomias grinned.

> *“Not so far but, judging by that raincloud grey you’re reading by, I’m feeling slightly more optimistic than you. This was your idea, you remember. I don’t know what you’re fretting about anyway, I think you look fine! It’s the Initiate’s Ball tonight, we could already be two drinks down, a girl on each arm. Well, one of us could be anyway.”* 

From behind a bookcase to the right, with a smile like warm water on aching muscles, a young woman of smooth, dark skin and raven hair appeared. Beside her, a meadow-green Library mage-light hung in the air.

> *“And which girls would those be, Tom?”*

> *“Name one in all of Founder’s University that wouldn’t enjoy a dance with Thomias Blake and I’ll name you a liar, Evangeline.”*

> *“Well then, the quicker we find what we’re looking for, the less time they should have to agonise for your company.”*

Thomias mumbled to himself and returned to combing the shelf in front of him. Ignatius bristled as Evangeline took a seat across from him at the table.

> *“We’ll find something, Nate, don’t worry”.*

Ignatius glanced away from her kind, searching face. His eyes followed the green of her mage-light across the wooden surface of the table and, to his shock, he saw his own flicker and begin to turn a pale lilac.

> *“Thank you, Evangeline, I-, I do appreciate the help.”*

Hastily, he stood and made his way to one of the grand, arched windows behind the bookcase Thomias was browsing. Moving toward the glass, he could hear Thomias saying -

> *“Hell, if we get out of here quick enough you might even get a dance with me, Evy!”*

*Careful, Tom.*

Ignatius placed his hands on the window ledge, the wood cold to the touch. He gazed out into the early-evening light over the city and sighed. Samosetia. Capital of Alcadena. Beneath the imposing Palace of the Senate and the various spires and towers of the Academic Quarter, he could see the canals winding and twisting through the streets like veins on the back of a hand.

*A son of fire in a city of water.*

Beyond the outskirts of Samosetia, to his right, the Whispering Mountains towered over even the tallest structure, casting their long shadow over the buildings below. To the West, in the farthest light of the setting sun, he could just make out the dark patch of The Quagmire, the Marismentan slum clinging to the city-limits like a limpet to a rock.

*How far you’ve come already...*

A scuffle behind him shook Ignatius from his thoughts and he turned with a start. Looming, removing a book from a shelf Ignatius couldn’t have reached on his tip-toes, the Marismente turned his head to observe him. Two large, milky, spherical eyes in a face of murky green.

> *“Apologies, Professor. I didn’t see you there.”*

> *“This city is bewitching to most, Mr. Barnett. You’d do well not to get lost in it.”*

In Common, his voice was like the whisper of wind through reeds. The Professor gave a slight nod of his head, removed his chosen book from the shelf and walked away. Ignatius followed and gripped the edge of the bookcase as he watched the tall figure gracefully pace toward the far end of the Main Hall and beyond sight, his mage-light shining a cerulean blue onto the floor beneath his bare, webbed feet.

Ignatius returned to Thomias and Evangeline, deep in some conversation he had not heard the beginning of. Thomias looked up at him with a glint as he approached.

> *“What do you say, Nate? When the three of us graduate, we’ll hit the frontier. There’s no room for the likes of us here in the city, we need to make our fortune out there, where the world is still new. Evangeline thinks so too.”*

> *“And how exactly do you plan to do that, Tom? Assuming you do graduate. You’ve about as much business acumen as I do, and even less money.”*

> *“Well, that’s where Evy comes in! She’s School of the Servant, you and I are School of the Craftsman. Why, with her mastery of commerce, your skills with fire, and my boundless charm we’re certain to get somewhere! You’ve heard of the plans for the railways? I’m telling you, Nate, this new world will be forged in steel, and we three will be the ones to do it!”*

> *“I hate to fan the flame, Ignatius, but Thomias may have a point here...”*

> *“An interesting proposition. And the funds?”*

> *“Well, you’ve got them jewels in the room sitting doing not very much, why don’t we shift them? I’m sure you won’t miss ‘em, Nate.”*

*We belong to the fire, my love, never forget that.*

> *"No, Tom. Just keep looking.”*

Ignatius saw Thomias and Evangeline’s faces drop slightly as his mage-light turned a searing orange. He turned and took shelter behind the nearest bookcase, eyes glazing over as he began to take books from the shelf.

He was back in Calimport. A glimmer of dust moved over the sandstone floor as his mother gazed out of the window, her scarlet-red skin shining in the evening sun. Outside, the tang of salt-air and the gentle rush of the sea above the call of birds, sailing out over the blue horizon.

> *“Why so glum, my love? It’s such a beautiful evening.”*

> *“Can we go and see the ships, Mother? Maybe there’ll be oysters again at the docks.”*

His mother floated over to him from the window, and cupped his small face in her hands. Each radiated a deep warmth, like two beds of hot sand in the afternoon sun. When the knock at the door came, Ignatius flinched.

> *“Not tonight, my love, I’m sorry. Why don’t you head upstairs and set up another game? I’ll call on you when I’m ready.”*

When his mother stood to answer the door, Ignatius was already half way up the stairs. Before closing the bedroom door behind him, he heard an unfamiliar deep voice mumbling and the too familiar clink of gold coins on their table.

Taking a chair and propping it against the door, Ignatius turned to the desk in front of him and began moving the scattered chess pieces there into their positions on the adjacent marble board. He picked up a black pawn, and turned it in his fingers as he studied it, ember-orange lines in his skin glowing intensely.

*Remember my love, even a pawn can become a queen, if it makes it all the way to the other side. You just have to get it there.*

Ignatius threw the small, marble figure across the room to the bed, and caught sight of the chest beneath. Opening the lid, he looked inside at the three glowing fire-opals that sat there.

*These are made of flame, like us. They remind of us what we are. We belong to the fire, my love, never forget that.*

Ignatius felt a hand at his wrist, and suddenly he was back in the Library of Founder’s University. Behind him, Evangeline stood silently. Her eyes, wide and brown like two fallen chestnuts amid the first scattered leaves of Eleint, stared into his.

> *“I’m sorry, Evangeline, I didn’t mean to snap at Tom, I just...”*

Evangeline stood on her tip-toes as she pressed her lips to his. In his skin, he could feel the warmth pulse and rise to his cheeks. For a single instant, he was no longer himself but part of something more, something whole. As they parted, he looked at her and smiled in the gentle, lilac glow of their mage-lights.

> *“Nate! Evy! I’ve got it!”*

Evangeline returned his smile, and led him out from behind the bookcase, back to Thomias.

> *“Stand still Nate, these instructions are good but it’s not my forte by a long shot. Still, whatever happens it’s bound to be an improvement...”*

Ignatius didn’t have time to respond before he felt a cold wash over him. The words Thomias was saying, whatever they were, became muffled and faint as he moved the book in his hands in waving patterns in the air in front of him. He looked down and saw the coal-black of his arms fade, and the ember-orange lines twisting up them cool. Steam seemed to rise from his skin as it changed, becoming fainter, fainter, until ashen-grey.

*I don’t believe it. Almost... normal.*

When it was over, he looked at Thomias and Evangeline, studying their faces for reaction.

> “Well, I did warn you it wouldn’t be perfect, but even if I do say so myself that’s a pretty damn fine job for a first attempt.”

> *“Did it work?”*

> *“Only you can tell us that, Ignatius”.*

Evangeline’s mage-light had become a distant sepia.

> *“Thank you, Tom.”*

> *“Well, whatever makes you happy, buddy. Now, unless you’d like to squeeze in any more reading or brooding, we can still make the Initiate’s Ball. We’ll just have to catch up on the drinking.”*

As they left the Library, their mage-lights soundlessly extinguishing at the threshold, Ignatius put his arms around the shoulders of his friends. This new world would belong to them. Together, maybe they could make it all the way to the other side of the board.

*Forged in steel. For once, he might just be right.*
