# The Events of Session 27

The Players pack up camp in the clearing in [[Lenity Woods]]. After waiting for [[Amotti]] to make a cup of tea, which he does using Ralph's chest cavity as a kettle and the loose tea leaves he stole from [[Issy]], they set out beyond the wood's edge. They find that the landscape changes dramatically here. Dense undergrowth gives way to dry, dusty plain. [[The Dustlands]] between Lenity Woods and [[Fortuna Outpost]] are a barren waste characterised by undulating dust-clouds and a shimmering, heat-soaked horizon.

[[Caeldrid Àrmann an Gealach|Caeldrid]] sends Gwynevere to scout ahead as far as she can, and his companion owl is able to pick out a few dark shapes in the otherwise bare plain just a few miles to the West of the Players position. They decide to head in this direction. The minutes pass. Maybe hours. With the edge of the woods behind them, their surroundings suddenly become hypnotically repetitive. The dust-clouds swirl, the horizon stays beyond their reach and the sun climbs in the sky. Eventually, large silhouettes form in the clearing haze.

The Players come across two dead owl-buffalo in differing states of decay. Upon investigation, Caeldrid deduces that they have died of dehydration. Puzzled by this discovery, it takes the Players a moment to realise that this space is also occupied by a travelling wagon – drawn by a single horse and covered by a canvas tent. From behind one of the owl-buffalo carcasses, a figure emerges. He is jolly and rotund, with a full beard and a weathered face. He greets the Players and introduces himself as [[Pastor Jeremiah]] a travelling evangelist here for "a spot of fishing".

Jeremiah explains that he was on his way through the Dustlands, but in his travels has become concerned for his friend [[Brez-ak]] (whom he describes as a [[Marismente|Marismentan]] shaman who also wanders these parts). Examining the corpses of the owl-buffalo, he expresses worry that Brez-ak may have been taken by a group of local creatures whom he calls [[The Dust-dwellers]]. Jeremiah tells the group that the Dust-dwellers occupy a network of canyons further into the plain, and rarely hunt during sunlight hours, but that they have recently been growing bolder and venturing further from their traditional territory. He laments the fading of this land, and tells the Players that he and Brez-ak share the same purpose, namely the revitalisation of the life here that has suffered from the ongoing drought and pestilence.

Upon hearing that the Players intend to make their way to Fortuna Outpost, Jeremiah indicates that he knows of it. He remarks that both he and the Players must have come into some luck. In order to make their way as safely as possible to Fortuna, they will have to pass through the canyon network, as the criss-crossing canyons make above ground progress almost impossible and the skies here are patrolled by aerial predators. He offers to guide the Players through in return for helping them search for Brez-ak, to which they agree.

On their way to the canyon entrance, [[Sel]] notices a faint glow from Jeremiah's wagon. The Pastor explains that he has a collection of fireflies, which line the interior shelves in various sizes of glass jar. Sel also looks to the skies, and he and [[Elias Blackwood|Eli]] notice large, winged creatures circling far overhead which move on further to the West. Eventually reaching the canyon entrance, the group split themselves among the two wagons with Caeldrid, [[Lythara Sunstrider|Lythara]] and [[Wild Bill]] occupying Jeremiah's (in an attempt to shield the most intimidating members of the party and appear weaker than they actually are to lure out unsuspecting predators).

Inside the canyons, they find the space enclosed on both sides by 40 ft walls. There is a persistent half-light here, an eerie terrain of constantly-shifting shadows where the settling dust from above plays tricks on the eyes and mind. Scouring the lip of the ridges above them, Wild Bill sees a puff of dust and a few scraps of unsettled rock tap their way down the canyon wall. The group reach a cross-roads, where the wide central canyon continues onward but is flanked by two smaller passageways to the left and right. Jeremiah pulls up his wagon and begins distractedly grumbling to himself and looking at something on the ground. Eli surveys their surroundings. He develops an uneasy sensation in his stomach when looking at a particular part of the canyon wall, and for a second begins to make out the outline of a humanoid figure watching him with two large, round, brown eyes. He is distracted by a cough from Jeremiah and, when returning his gaze to the position of the figure, finds only bare wall and a small cloud of dust settling to the floor.

Amotti impulsively drives the Players wagon (with Sel inside) down the right-hand passage. A little way down it, his confidence begins to waver. Subconsciously or not, he lets go of the reigns and the wagon pulls to a stop and all falls silent. The stillness is pierced by a muffled cry.

> *"H....heeeelp......I'm down heeeeeree... h...heeeeelp."*

Sel resists the urge to immediately seek the source of the noise, instead crying out in response. He receives a reply.

> *"H....heeeelp......I'm down heeeeeree... h...heeeeelp."*

His suspicions are raised. The response was the same as the first call. Exactly the same. Sel becomes wary of a trap. Meanwhile, Wild Bill, Jeremiah and Lythara follow down the right-hand passage. Wild Bill readies his pistols, and when a cloud of dust is disturbed on the canyon wall he instinctively draws and fires. A high-pitch scream is let out, and a creature, previously perfectly camouflaged in red-brown, is revealed in grey-green, leathery skin. Holding its arm in pain, it falls to the canyon floor. The Players see that the figure is humanoid, with sinewy limbs and elongated fingers and toes. Its ovoid head is dominated by a circular mouth lined with rows of teeth, with no obvious eyes. Jeremiah confirms it to be one of the Dust-dwellers. It writhes in pain. Sel casts Web on the creature, and suspends it in a thick network of sticky silk.

Amotti and Lythara cut their way through the web toward the creature. Amotti magically puts it to sleep for just long enough for Lythara to subdue it under her foot, pressing her glaive against its neck. The creature wakes and studies Lythara with large, brown eyes revealed from under two previously invisible lids on its head. Lythara demands that it tell them how many more there are nearby. The creatures makes strange shapes with its mouth and an uncanny sound emerges, like a mockingbird imitating a song.

> *"H....heeeelp......I'm down heeeeeree... h...heeeeelp."*

Lythara, horrified, tightens her grip on the glaive. The creature tries to wriggle free, only serving to injure itself more and more on the blade. Jeremiah winces and asks Lythara to stop as the Dust-dweller begins to squeal in pain. Lythara throws it once more onto the web and it hangs, blood dripping from the gash in its neck. Approaching the dying creature sombrely, Jeremiah takes out a hefty tome which he uses as a weapon, The Good Book, and mercy-kills it. Afterward, he mysteriously draws a faintly-glowing green firefly from its head and places it in a jar.

Jeremiah, Lythara, Amotti, Wild Bill and Sel rejoin the others at the crossroads. Eli discovers that, on the ground at the central passage, there is evidence of a large creature being dragged along the ground up the central pathway. [[Gambit]] estimates the tracks were made about a day ago, to which Jeremiah points out that he hasn't seen Brez-ak for at least a full tenday. The Players ponder this, and look up the canyon path to where it trails off round the bend, considering their next move...
