# The Events of Session 28

Following the tracks in the dusty ground, the Players decide to head down the central canyon path. They leave [[Wild Bill]] and [[Lythara Sunstrider|Lythara]] with the horses and wagons at the crossroads. [[Caeldrid Àrmann an Gealach|Caeldrid]] once again sends the owl, Gwynevere, ahead to scout their path. Through her keen eyes, he sees that this canyon ends in a dark cave entrance, outside of which two [[The Dust-dwellers|Dust-dwellers]] crouch. They appear to converse with each other, of a fashion, using a strange series of clicks and head gestures. After Caeldrid relays the lay of the land, [[Sel]] proposes that [[Elias Blackwood|Eli]] go forth alone to scope out the cave. Eli agrees, and is bestowed with several magical boons by [[Pastor Jeremiah|Jeremiah]], Sel and [[Amotti]] to aid in his stealth and protection.

Eli enters the cave, successfully sneaking past the dust-dwellers lingering outside the entrance. Inside, he finds that the environment here is considerably different to the canyon outside. The walls of the cave are lined with sparse patches of a thick, damp moss. Stalactites hang from the ceiling, and from them clear water condenses into drips which pool on the floor. The interior is lit intermittently with flashes of blue light which appear from within the pools.

Eli pushes forward, wary of his footing, and eventually reaches a fork in the tunnel. He veers down a path to his right, and enters a much larger cavern in which the air and terrain is much drier and hotter than the cool, moss-covered tunnels. In here, Eli can see only by his dark-vision. He explores the perimeter of the cavern and, to his horror, discovers several nesting and dormant dust-dwellers. Following a shaft of light with his eyes to the ceiling, he sees tens of the creatures clinging to hanging stalactites as they rest. He bravely explores the rest of the area, but finds nothing of use.

Returning to take the alternative path, Eli reaches a section of tunnel in which the moss grows thicker and the pools swell deeper. He hears a scrambling noise heading toward him from deeper in, and presses against the wall as two dust-dwellers crawl past - pushing himself into a patch of moss in the process. Breathing a sigh of relief and continuing on, Eli suddenly feels a cold grip on his ankle and is swallowed by darkness.

The group muse worriedly on Eli’s prolonged absence. [[Gambit]] volunteers to go in search of him alone. Based on a vivid description from Sel, he is able to magically disguise himself as a fairly accurate copy of one of the dust-dwellers. He uses this disguise to move past the two creatures still bickering at the cave entrance and moves inside. Eventually reaching the same tunnel as Eli, but with no sign of his friend, Gambit too feels something tighten around his ankle and is pulled into shadow.

Two members down and panicking, the rest of the Players decide to draw arms and move in strength to rescue [[Brez-ak]] and their friends. Amotti distracts the dust-dwellers at the cave entrance by illuminating them with faerie-fire. One scrambles away, but he and Sel subdue the other with Toll the Dead. The creature writhes in pain and grasps at its head on the canyon floor, and Jeremiah solemnly snuffs out its life with a strike from The Good Book. He collects another firefly from the creature after he does.

The group proceed into the cave. Caeldrid lights the way with the green glow of his sword, while Jeremiah causes an orange light to emanate from The Good Book - providing further illumination. Reaching the fork in the tunnel, Amotti sinks to his knees and beseeches his twin goddesses [[Eilistraee]] and [[Lolth]] for guidance on the way ahead. Only silence and darkness in response. Amotti scrunches his eyes closed and tries to focus. Eventually, he sees a soft, green light emerge in the periphery of his vision. However, upon opening his eyes, this is revealed to be merely the light from Caeldrid’s sword as his companion kneels to check on him. Amotti stands in frustration and Caeldrid indicates to the group that he favours the left path.

The Players reach the tunnel where Eli and Gambit were taken. As they progress, Caeldrid is tripped by an unseen force and cries out as he is dragged along the ground. Jeremiah reaches down to grab his arms, and sees that a tendril of icy-blue water has risen from one of the pools in the floor and has wrapped around Caeldrid’s ankle. As it tries to drag Caeldrid into its pool, Jeremiah severs its grip by bringing The Good Book down on it. He then smacks away another tendril as it attempts to grab him. As tendrils begin to rise from all the pools in the tunnel, the group run.

They manage to outrun their would-be captors, and reach a portion of the tunnel where a foul stench fills the air. In an opening in the left wall, they find a pit filled with carcasses in varying states of decay. Some animal, some human. Covering his nose and mouth, Sel investigates further. On the corpse pile, he finds the skeletal remains of a Protectorate soldier - identifiable by the sigil on his remaining armour. From around the fallen soldier’s neck, Sel recovers a locket of burnished copper. Opening the clasp, he finds a pictogram of a young girl with black hair and light eyes inside. Jeremiah enters the pit and prays for the fallen. The cavern is lit in sombre green as fireflies rise from the corpses, which Jeremiah dutifully collects.

The Players finally reach the end of the cave system. They enter a large cavern, bathed in the flickering light of two braziers burning with purple flame. The space is dominated by natural pillars formed from the rock. On the left and right, they see Gambit and Eli muffled, bound and suspended upside-down by tendrils of water. At the base of the central pillar, a figure stands hunched over an altar with his back to the group. The figure is nine feet tall, with mottled grey-green skin. His sea-kelp hair is braided in intricate patterns down his scalp and the back of his neck. In his right hand, he holds a staff carved from driftwood which glows an iridescent blue. He turns to face the Players.

Jeremiah gasps as he recognises his friend, Brez-ak. Where once was a kind and wise face with large, milky-white eyes, now a sneer forms from beneath two eyes corrupted with purple light. Brez-ak, his words rasping and haunting in the Common tongue, addresses Jeremiah.

> *“You’re still fighting it, aren’t you Jeremiah? You fool. You think I don’t see you, Balsero? You know all too well how hopeless our decline already is. The Consumer is too powerful, even now. All will perish in its wake. Our only choice is to cower and try to scrape what we can. So the mistress says. She found me and showed me the truth. She lent me the strength to control these lost creatures and bend them to my will.”*

Jeremiah spits with rage and labels Brez-ak a fool. As he does, his former friend smiles and raises his hands. From the walls and ceilings of the cavern, the dust-dwellers descend at his behest.

The Players rush into battle. The dust-dwellers leap onto Amotti and Jeremiah, draining their life-energy with their sucking bites. All the while, Brez-ak casts binding magic from his staff in an attempt to snare the Players. Caeldrid rushes him and the two engage in a fierce melee. Caeldrid and Brez-ak lock eyes, exchanging blow after blow. Brez-ak catches Caeldrid full on the jaw with a crushing blow from his staff, crunching bone and sending teeth flying. Seeing this, Sel focuses all his will on reversing the strike. In front of him, an ethereal blue clock appears. As he strains to control the flow of time, the hands reverse. Caeldrid’s teeth return through the air to his mouth and Brez-ak’s blow is retracted.

Emboldened and taking advantage of his enemy’s confusion, Caeldrid attacks with a flurry of wicked blows. He and Brez-ak dance as sword meets water and staff and the cavern rings with the song of parry and riposte. Caeldrid feigns a punch with a gauntleted fist and Brez-ak instinctively raises his staff to block it. In the gap in his foe’s guard, Caeldrid drives his sword up through Brez-ak’s ribs and twists - pulling it free as the corrupted shaman sinks to his knees.

A change comes over the dust-dwellers. They stop their fight, and turn on their tormenter. Fear flashes in Brez-ak’s eyes as they stalk toward him. One opens its jaws, and utters a cruel mimicry.

> *“All will perish…”*

The creatures pounce on Brez-ak and devour him. Jeremiah turns and bows his head, in reverence of his lost friend.
