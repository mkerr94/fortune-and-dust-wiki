# The Events of Session 26

The young soldier lies face first at the threshold of the Town Hall. [[Thomias Blake]], simmering with uncertainty but decisive in his actions, orders [[Holden Smith|Holden]] to carry the body to the lock-up and the gathered townsfolk to return to their homes. Holden drags the limp body of the soldier into the lock-up by the underarms, [[Alvina]] curiously sniffing at its legs. Thomias follows and gestures to the Players to join him. In the lock-up, Holden pushes through into the first cell on the left. He hoists the body onto the low bed and sinks into a squat, rubbing his face.

> *"When will it end, Tom? What is happening to us?"*

[[Caeldrid Àrmann an Gealach|Caeldrid]] and [[Sel]] examine the body of the young man ([[The Young Soldier]]). They see that he is a human, likely in his early twenties. He has rough brown hair and a light beard. He wears soldiers leathers, resembling those of a Roman centurion, but trimmed with fading gold paint. At the centre of his chest-piece, there is a symbol: a downward facing sword, unsheathed, with a lidless and watchful eye at the centre of its hilt.

The soldier has blood covering most of his face and hands. Sel discovers that the blood on his face has come from a blunt trauma wound on his forehead, like that caused by being slammed by the butt of a rifle, and deduces that this was likely the cause of death. He also finds a small lump of whittled charcoal on the young man's person, and a matching set of markings on his inner-right forearm – tally marks totalling to the number six. Still clasped in the boy's stiffened left hand, Caeldrid finds Old Mags letter to the [[Fortuna Outpost]]:

> *"To the watchful brothers of Fortuna Outpost,*
> 
> *I send this letter in distress from the town of Clement's Hollow, your neighbour to the East. There is an unknown sickness spreading through local wildlife, causing strange mutations. We have suffered several losses, and are beset at our walls by attacks from abnormal creatures. Consider this a formal request for martial aid, and a reminder of our strategic importance to the Vanderbilt Rail Co.*
> 
> *Yours,*
> 
> *Magnolia Aurix, Lawmaster of Clement's Hollow"*

Thomias laments the troubled times that have led to his taking charge of [[Clement's Hollow]], and lets the players know that [[Ignatius 'Nate' Barnett|Ignatius]] has informed him of their imminent departure for the outpost. He has arranged and paid for horses to be made ready for them by [[Jebediah ‘Jeb’ Clayborn|Jebediah Clayborn]] – who awaits them at the stables. Hearing that the Players are headed for Fortuna, Holden offers some advice:

> *"You heading to the Outpost? I ain't never been there myself, but I know the way. My place is here with the town but I can at least point you in the right direction. There's a path, runs behind [['Aunt' Elsie-May|Elsie-May]]'s boathouse through the Western side of [[Lenity Woods]] along the lake shore. I'd recommend making camp for the night when you reach the wood's edge. Beyond that is only dust-land now, keep heading West and you'll find Fortuna. I hope you find what you're looking for."*

This information in hand, and with Holden agreeing to see them as far as the boathouse, the Players turn to leave. As they do, there is a coughing and spluttering from behind them. They turn to find the young soldier sat bolt-upright, wide-eyed and staring vacantly at a space somewhere beyond them. He begins to speak incoherently:

> *"Six times. I am the watchful sword of the Warrior, my brothers are my hilt. Six times. None shall trespass against us or those our swords protect. Six times. There is no protection from her, there's no relief. Six times. She sees us all, inside and out. Insides, out. Six times. A watcher in the dark. Six times. Warrior forgive them, forgive me..."*

His last words are cut off as he looks with a flash of recognition at the Players and his form beings to fade, turning transparent and eventually disappearing altogether. Holden and Thomias share a stunned look.

> *"I don't know what you're heading into, but I wish you all the luck in the world."*

The Players leave the Town Hall for the stables, with [[Wild Bill]] first going to visit Ignatius Barnett in his office in the [[The Barnett-Blake Ironworks|Barnett-Blake Ironworks]]. Bill theorises that there may be a possible link between [[The Furnace Spider]] the Players defeated during their exploration of the Ironworks, the spiders left by the remains of the Drow spy the Players intercepted during [[Session 12]] who made mention of a 'mistress', and the phrase 'she sees us' uttered by the soldier before collapsing at the Town Hall. He questions Ignatius about the creature's potential origins. Admitting he himself doesn't fully understand how it came into being, Ignatius theorises that, as one of the fire-opals was found at the centre of the spider after its defeat, the creature was a manifestation of Ignatius' own pyromantic powers somehow amplified through the power of the opal. He proposes that, as a defence mechanism, the creature was formed by the opal using materials nearby (iron, molten ore and t[[The Hollowsteel Blade]]). As evidence for this, Ignatius points out the glassy golems formed by the opals during his fight with the Players, the conjuring of which he admits is beyond his own powers to the best of his knowledge. Wild Bill thanks Ignatius and leaves the Ironworks slightly bemused, relaying the information he obtained as best he can to the others.

At the stables, the Players find the whole Clayborn family at work. Jeb provides them with two horses (one brown stallion which they name Kelpie and one black mare which they name Embe) as well as a simple wooden cart designed for bearing goods but big enough to seat four of them comfortably for travel. [[Sam Clayborn|Sam]] happily thanks the Players for everything they have done and expresses his wish to see them again in town, but [[Hattie Clayborn|Hattie]] seems more reserved. With the Players on the verge of leaving, she catches Caeldrid at the threshold.

> *"You're leaving for good, aren't you?"*

Caeldrid nods, and explains that he has a mission to fulfil, and other people in need to help. Hattie kicks some dust off the ground and looks at him with soulful, green eyes.

> *"And what if someone here still needs your help too?"*

Hesitant, Caeldrid takes a step toward her. Making a final apology and whispering a goodbye, he leans in to kiss her on the cheek. In response, Hattie puts one hand around his waist and pushes the other through his hair. She grips the back of Caeldrid's head and pulls him into a passionate kiss, which she ends on her terms, leaving Caeldrid with one last warning as she looks in his eyes.

> *"Just don't you go forgetting about us, cowboy."*

Somewhat in shock, Caeldrid turns to regroup with the others and Holden as Hattie goes back to her family. To his embarrassment, he finds that the Players and Holden have been keenly watching his entire interaction with Hattie, and Holden shoots him a knowing glance before suggesting that they get going.

He leads the Players to a spot beyond his boathouse, where a trodden path on the lakeshore leads into a denser section of Lenity Woods, seeing the Players on their way.

> *"I'll live up to her legacy, you know. Mags. I'll make her proud."*

The Players head into the woods and, following the path, their senses are lulled somewhat by the swirling lake-fog and the rhythmic lapping of the waves. Talking as they progress and the sun crests and falls in the sky, they begin to discuss what they might find in Fortuna, and reveal details about their respective pasts.

Considering the theories posed by Wild Bill, [[Amotti]] deliberates further on a possible connection between the spiders in his nightmare in [[Session 3]], the spiders left behind by the drow spy in Session 12, and the fate of the young soldier from Fortuna. He reveals that he has come to [[Alcadeña]] to distance himself from his sister, [[Maeve]], who he explains is a powerful follower of the drow spider-goddess, [[Lolth]]. In Faerun, Lolth ordered Maeve to violently conquer surface settlements, which Amotti could not be party to. So he ran. He recounts that he and Maeve are both of house Xai, and Sel questions him on his heraldry – revealing he himself has an extensive knowledge of the civilisation of the Underdark which he explains ad nauseum. Amotti continues that he and Maeve were both chosen by Lolth to act on her behalf on the material plane. While he still follows Lolth, he also follows her counterpart [[Eilistraee]] – the goddess of beauty and moonlight. He wears earrings embodying both goddesses from which he draws his magic, believing firmly in achieving a balance between the light and dark. To this end, he reveals that in Faerun he was part of a drow sect called the 'Twilight Keepers'.

In response, Sel proclaims that he too is from the Underdark, and that his name in fact means 'a new dawn' in Drow. He explains that he is from the Underdark city of Menzoberranzan, where his egg was sold into the service of a Drow chronurgist wizard. [[Elias Blackwood|Eli]] reveals that he is from a different sort of underworld, that of investigating and rooting out the corruption and criminality in the city of Waterdeep. Wild Bill states that he merely comes from a simple farm life, having left it behind with his father's horse, Rusty Jack, to seek adventure and fortune. Finally, Caeldrid explains that he too is from a farm, though unlike the homestead described by Bill. He left his village to secure money and resources for its continued survival.

Eventually, the group come to a peaceful, firefly-lit clearing where they make camp. Wild Bill hitches up Rusty Jack, and notices the crunch of dry vegetation under his feet. He sees that, at the edge of the clearing and beyond the influence of the lake-fog, the plant life appears to become drier and less dense. Returning to the rest of the group, he feels a light gust of hot, dusty, dry air on the back of his neck.
