# The Events of Session 8
Session 8 begins with [[Amotti]] considering his next move in the [[Clayborn Inn]], alone. With the rest of the party attending the funeral service for [[Whip]] at the town stables, he has been tasked with procuring a boat to allow them to venture to the island on the lake where [[Ignatius 'Nate' Barnett|Ignatius]]' shack awaits. He considers that, the previous night, [[Holden Smith|Holden]] had agreed to give the players use of a boat previously belonging to his [['Aunt' Elsie-May]], but warned that it needs some fixing before being taken out on the water.

Naturally then, Amotti begins his explorations at [[Issy]]'s house, finding the door to the old dwarven woman's abode open. After searching Issy's home for a few minutes, to no avail, he leaves her a note asking if she knows anything about boats. He retires to the rocking chair on Issy's porch and begins to ritualistically commune with his gods for counsel using his twin earrings. Ever so faintly, he makes contact.

Seek the house on the lake...

Leaving Issy's, Amotti then decides his next logical step is to try and gain entry to [[Tryst's General Store]], hoping to explore the upstairs room being rented by [[Red]]. After unsuccessfully trying to force the door, he begins to make his way back into the town before his attention is turned by the gentle tapping of the open upstairs window in the wind. With no clear way to make his way up, he attempts to scale a drainpipe on the side of the store that leads to the roof, but finds the task too much.

Down-heartened and growing short on time, Amotti leaves [[Clement's Hollow]] through the Western Gate and along the shores of [[Lake Lenity]], heading in the opposite direction of the house on the lake and toward the [[Lakeside Marismente Camp]]. Greeted by a slightly confused guard on the camp's edge, but encouraged after seeing some [[Marismente]] fishing just off the nearby shore, he persuades his way in.

Being led to the central fire-pit where the players had sat just the previous night, he is granted brief audience with [[Rel-se]], resplendent in her blue sea-glass wrist guard and circlet. Making it clear that he wishes to borrow one of the Marismentan lake-boats, Rel-se becomes concerned and warns starkly against venturing too far out onto Lake Lenity. In response, Amotti attempts to magically command Rel-se to give him a boat, to seemingly no effect. Rebuffed, Rel-se's personal guard, [[Gur-ak and Sut-ak|Gur-ak]], shows Amotti out of the camp, warming to him slightly and even cracking a smile at the bold efforts of the young Drow to get what he wants.

Finally heeding the advice of his gods, Amotti makes his way to Holden and [[Alvina]]'s boathouse. In the small inlet on the bottom floor which allows boats to be taken directly out on the lake via the workshop, he finds a suitable boat big enough to ferry the entire party. He is discovered by a curious Alvina, who quickly recognises him and shows playful interest in his attempts to move the boat. On inspection, Amotti finds that, as Holden warned, the boat's hull is damaged.

Quickly realising that the boat must of course be removed from the boat workshop to be fixed, Amotti wakes a visibly dishevelled and bemused Holden from his upstairs quarters and convinces him in his half-awake state to help him carry the boat back into town.

The two then regroup with the rest of the players, who are just leaving the funeral at the stables, and Holden goes inside to pay his respects.

While Amotti proudly shows his procurement to the rest of the players, [[Wild Bill]] and [[Lythara Sunstrider|Lythara]] quietly discuss Amotti's role in the group and whether or not his erratic behaviour may eventually harm their chances of successfully completing the task outlined to them by the [[Vanderbilt Contract]]. Lythara coyly suggests that, should the need arise, they could remove Amotti by force.

The players then take the boat back to the boat workshop to work on it and, after procuring some suitable wood from a nearby barrel, [[Gambit]] puts his artificier skills to work in repairing the hull. While he does, [[Sel]] and Wild Bill take a peaceful moment outside by the lake. In the fading light of the late afternoon, the two silently take stock of the quiet beauty of the scene and observe the lake-fog shift and swirl over the bottle-green water. Sel writes a letter and stuffs it next to the many others in his rucksack, while Wild Bill warns that in the limited visibility further out on the lake he may be hampered in the use of his revolvers should the need arise.

Meanwhile, [[Caeldrid Àrmann an Gealach|Caeldrid]] and Amotti discuss what they hope to find when they reach the shack. Caeldrid admits that he doesn't know, but stresses that they cannot ignore it given the building suspicion around Ignatius' activities there and the warning received the previous night from the Marismente that more monsters lurk further out on the lake.

As Gambit announces the successful repair of the boat, Holden returns from the stables. He is asked by Sel to mention to Ignatius that the party are heading to the island in order to gauge his reaction and, although hesitant at first, reluctantly agrees and accepts payment for the task.

Finally, the party board the boat (which they name 'Whisper on the Wind') and embark out on the lake. They tie two spare rowing boats from the workshop to the stern. In the flickering torchlight and the soft glow of Amotti's Dancing Lights, with Gwynevere flying overhead, the players look out on their destination – determined to discover what lies beyond the fog...
