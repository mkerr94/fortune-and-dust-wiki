# The Events of Session 6
The players begin Session 6 in the bar of the [[Clayborn Inn]], digesting both their humble breakfast and [[Sel]]'s plan for the upcoming town meeting. Learning that the meeting won't be until the early evening, they resolve to use the time available to them beforehand to explore more of [[Clement's Hollow]] and learn what they can from its strange menagerie of residents.

Deciding to head first to [[The Barnett-Blake Ironworks|Barnett-Blake Ironworks]] in order to question its proprietor, [[Ignatius 'Nate' Barnett]], they find the streets outside beginning to fill with nervous, evasive townsfolk. Inside the Ironworks, the players get their first sense of the searing industrial furnace at the economic heart of Clement's Hollow. They also catch their first glimpse of the [[Marismente]], who are revealed to be tall, sinewy grey-green figures with elongated limbs, webbed digits and large, milky grey-white eyes. They observe some of the Marismente using hydromancy to transfer water between aqueducts and cool molten iron.

Making their way to the upper floor via the iron gangways on either side of the main hall, they reach the door to Ignatius 'Nate' Barnett's office. The doors are made of ornate ironwork, and adorned by a heavy knocker in the shape of a crossed pickaxe and shovel against a prism jewel – which they later learn to be the symbol of the Craftsman, an apparent deity worshipped by some of the townsfolk. In addition, the doors are set with three egg-shaped, bewitching red fire-opals, which seem to swirl and burn internally. Inside the office, the players meet Nate. Charming and articulate, but showing signs of stress and tiredness, Nate welcomes the players and thanks them for their efforts in defending the town. From their conversation with him, the players discuss how best to meet with the Marismente – for which Nate recommends simply approaching them respectfully if they mean them no harm. They also discuss the Ironwork's ongoing contract to provide material to the [[Vanderbilt Railway Company]], the success of which Ignatius believes to be key to improving the town's economic prospects. Observing Nate during their conversation, Sel realises that he is a fire-genasi, which appears to make Nate nervous.

Leaving the Ironworks, the players decide to identify other locations of note around town, finding: the town hall; [[Tryst's General Store]]; and the [[Temple of the Craftsman]]. They decide to delay their enquiries at [[Slim Ed]]'s ranch until the following day. Entering the General Store, [[Lythara Sunstrider|Lythara]] and [[Amotti]] meet [[Clarence Tryst|Clarence]], the owner, for the first time. While Lythara talks with Clarence about the events of last night and the mage-born lodger occupying his upstairs room, Amotti chances upon [[Issy]] browsing the wares. She invites the party to her home later for tea, which Amotti accepts – despite Issy showing signs of incoherence.

>"Would you boys like some tea?"

Returning to the Inn to pass time before the meeting, the players gamble for truths in the bar. Sel wins the prize of learning [[Wild Bill]]'s true name – which he later claims in secret. The group discuss plans to survey key figures separately during the meeting, while [[Elias Blackwood|Elias]] attempts to force his way into the Ironworks office under cover of invisibility granted by Sel.

With the meeting upon them and most of the town in attendance, the players (with the exception of Elias) take up strategic positions around the town hall and observe the proceedings. [[Magnolia 'Old Mags' Aurix|Old Mags]] leads the discussions, urging calm among the people and insisting that they deal solely in the facts of recent events and discard hearsay. She invites Sel to speak, and is visibly frustrated when he speaks of rumoured sickness in [[Alcadena]] and potential magical origin for the monsters outside the walls – prompting nervous grumblings among the crowd. Mags retorts by reiterating her desire for the search for the truth not to devolve into a witch hunt, and diminishing talk of the "Curse of Clement's Hollow" as tabloid fantasy. She reports that she intends to send word to the western Protectorate [[Fortuna Outpost]] to request martial aid, and that she, Holden, and two volunteer guards from the nearby Marismentan settlement will enforce a nightfall curfew until the town is safe again (which Lythara later negotiates exemption from for the players to continue their investigations).

Next invited to speak is [[Jessie 'Doc' Lawrence|Jessie Lawrence]], who reports that Whip has been prepared for a funeral and will be interred at the town stables on the morrow. Throughout Mags and Jessie's speeches, townsfolk from the restless crowd interject in anger on the potential danger of the visiting mage-born and the nearby 'quagers' - which Mags rebuffs. One even goes so far as to call out the disappearance of [[Marie Clayborn|Marie]] and [[Jedediah ‘Jeb’ Clayborn|Jeb]] Clayborn as an example of things spiralling out of control – prompting an angry response from Hattie which is quietly suppressed by [[Sam Clayborn|Sam]]. Wishing to shift the focus, Mags invites Ignatius to speak.

Ignatius stresses the importance of keeping things together to deliver on the agreement with the Vanderbilt Rail company, revealing to the players that [[Cornelius Vanderbilt|Vanderbilt]] himself visited the Ironworks to oversee the arrangements less than a month prior to their arrival. He then quickly excuses himself to return to the side of his ailing wife, [[Evangeline Barnett|Evangeline]]. As Ignatius leaves, the players turn to the entrance and see [[Red]] for the first time, who shares a brief and cagey introduction with [[Gambit]] before leaving. A visibly exasperated Mags calls the meeting to a close, and Sel uses the opportunity to fashion some alone time with [[Rel-se]], the matriarch of the lakeside Marismente.

Meanwhile, Elias (waiting outside the town hall to check for stragglers before enacting his plans) observes Red descending from the town hall roof with magic to avoid detection on his approach. Afterward, Eli uses the cover of the meeting to explore the Ironworks. Initially failing to break into the suspended secondary structure at the rear of the building, noting the ornate diamond-shaped lock on the entrance, he instead gains entry to the main building by way of a cellar door protruding from the ground at the back of the main work-hall. Inside, he finds various pieces of worked iron being stored and, strangely, a wooden rowing boat with intricate carvings. He eventually makes his way up to the door of Ignatius' office, but to his horror finds the three fire-opal jewels missing and the door impassable. With time running thin on Sel's invisibility charm, Elias decides instead to investigate the living quarters of the Clayborn Inn. While leaving the Ironworks, he observes a worker late for the town meeting leaving via the main door – the drawbar of which it is revealed is enchanted to appear weightless and restore itself to a barred state upon exit from the inside.

Inside the Clayborn Inn living quarters, Elias finds the key to the office in the front pocket of Sam Clayborn's dungarees – hanging up in his bedchamber. He also sees a pictogram of a younger Sam with a smiling woman of flowing red hair carrying a swaddled baby – Marie Clayborn after the birth of Hattie. In the office, Elias happens upon a heartbreaking secret. In a letter addressed "To my dearest, Sam" (see [[Marie Clayborn's Letter]]), it is revealed that Marie Clayborn has passed away from an unknown illness, a passing that Sam has clearly kept from his children and the rest of the town. Marie writes that Sam must be brave, not linger on her demise, and stay strong for his children. She expresses remorse at never having lived to see the dreams of Jeb and Hattie fulfilled, but urges Sam to encourage them to see the world. Finally, she thanks Sam for seeing her own dreams fulfilled, and wishes him her love – now, and always. Processing this revelation, Elias returns to his room at the inn to avoid raising suspicion on the Clayborn's return.

Outside of the town hall, Sel shares a brief moment with a frazzled Ignatius in which the latter expresses concerns over Mags and Holden's capability to protect Clement's Hollow from the dangers it faces. Later, he and Lythara attempt to communicate with Rel-se, and gather through mime and suggestion that she wishes to meet them and the party at the lakeside Marismente camp after sundown.

In the time before then, [[Caeldrid Àrmann an Gealach|Caeldrid]] takes leave to privately send his familiar, Gwynevere, on an as-yet-unspecified scouting mission while Gambit and Amotti fulfil their obligation for tea at Issy's house. Lythara negotiates exemption from the nightfall curfew with Mags, and learns of her past as an ex-soldier of the Protectorate – signified by a tattoo of a sword with an eye in its cross-guard on her neck.

>"Makes this old dragon feel spent to watch the young do what she should do herself."

In Issy's house, Gambit and Amotti learn what they can from the failing mind of the old dwarven woman. They learn that, after the founding of the Ironworks and the construction of Issy's home, her fishing shack on an island in Lake Lenity was purchased by Ignatius, who owns it to this day. They also learn that Issy can no longer remember her husband's name, but remembers his kind face. When Issy falls asleep, the pair use the cover to search her home, and discover an old rusted key which does not match the lock on her front door. They are later scolded angrily for this by Caeldrid for betraying the laws of hospitality – sacred to his people.

Finally reunited and ready for their date with destiny, as the sun sets on their first day in Clement's Hollow, the players venture out of the western gate to meet with the Marismente. First met by [[Arthur and Neall Carpenter]], overseeing the ashes of the burnt [[Mutant Lake-Lizards]], the pair joke with the party about the dangers of exploring the lake at night.

>"Gate's fixed up pretty nice but ain't gonna do you no good if you're on the other side of it!"

The players make their way toward the [[Lakeside Marismente Camp]], and are met by two male guards, Gur-ak and Sut-ak, who take their weapons and inspect their necks for [[The Protectorate|Protectorate]] tattoos. Ushered into the camp, the players observe the hexagonal wood and reed tents of the Marismente, their ornately carved boats, and their possession of Faerunian tools and currency. They are invited to sit at the central hearth, and are given refreshment of roasted Lenity catfish and purified lake-water.

From her tent, Rel-se emerges. She begins to communicate with the players via charcoal drawings made on a dried sheet of bark, which she creates by controlling the charcoal with tendrils of hydromantically-manipulated water. Through these means, she asks the players if they killed the three-headed lake-lizard, which they confirm. In response, a visibly sorrowful young Marismentan female and her father reward each of them with a small bead of cloudy-blue sea-glass, to be worn around their necks. With a hesitant but steadfast Caeldrid taking charge of the liaison, the players press Rel-se for more information.

They ask about different factions of the Marismente, to which Rel-se responds by gesturing to her camp and people before drawing the image of a large and sprawling tree on the bark. Caeldrid then asks if there are more dangerous creatures outside of the town, Rel-se nods. He asks if the Marismente know the source, to which she indicates the island in the centre of the lake. Most pressingly, the players ask about the recent sightings of the Marismentan militia near Clement's Hollow, and by extension Eva Vanderbilt. After confirming that the players mean them no harm, and deliberating carefully with her personal guard, Rel-se draws one final image on the bark. It shows two catfish, one light and one dark, in an eternal circle – one pursuing the other. This image provokes the onlooking camp-dwellers to nod their heads in reverence, and Rel-se sombrely passes it on to the party to keep.

Standing and gesturing to her guard that the night's meeting is at an end, Rel-se bows her head in respect as the players return to the town – struggling to process the revelations of their day. The sun sets over the shoreline and the lake-fog swirls as nightfall descends...
