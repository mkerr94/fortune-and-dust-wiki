# The Events of Session 7
Session 7 begins with the players returning from their sunset meeting with the [[Marismente]] of [[Lake Lenity]]. They digest the events and revelations of the night while returning to the town's Western Gate. In particular, the players discuss how they might make their way to the island shack mentioned by [[Issy]] earlier that evening – with the lake-fog growing thicker further from the shore and Gwynevere unable to discern any clues of the island's location from above. [[Amotti]], in search of a solution, reveals that he can conjure magical dancing lights to illuminate their passage – and the players witness these lights briefly parting the lake-fog when tested by him.

Outside the Western Gate, the players encounter [[Holden Smith]], who mentions that he is on his way to the Marismentan camp to make good on [[Rel-se]]'s promise of two of her personal guard to help with his watch. When asked about how best to traverse the lake, Holden admits that it was his Aunt [['Aunt' Elsie-May|Elsie-May]], the previous owner of his boathouse, that was the true lake-goer. He does however elaborate that he and Elsie-May came to [[Clement's Hollow]] after their homestead in Faerun was cleared by the landowners, and hints that Orc and Half-orc kind find a more tolerant welcome in [[Alcadeña]] than the Homeland.

Bidding goodnight to Holden and returning to the [[Clayborn Inn]], the players find a wistful [[Hattie Clayborn|Hattie]] manning the reception desk. She informs them that there will be a funeral service for [[Whip]] the next morning at the Stables. [[Wild Bill]] lingers outside for a moment to check on Rusty Jack, and when he returns Hattie implores him privately that he and the party do all they can to help find her brother [[Jedediah ‘Jeb’ Clayborn|Jeb]], although she admits she has no right to ask.

Upstairs, [[Elias Blackwood|Elias]] recounts his discoveries in the Clayborn Inn living quarters and the revelations of [[Marie Clayborn's Letter]] to [[Sel]] and [[Caeldrid Àrmann an Gealach|Caeldrid]], with Sel resolving to talk to Sam at Whip's funeral the next day (after failing to convince a confused Hattie to wake him from his sleep for a conversation). In turn, Sel reveals to Elias and Caeldrid that [[Ignatius 'Nate' Barnett|Ignatius Barnett]] is a fire-genasi. Before resigning himself to bed, Sel buys an expensive bottle of whisky from Hattie.

Elias suffers a restless sleep. In his dreams, he finds himself back at a familiar table, in a familiar home. A family gathered in the room idly chat to one another. A tall, lean man with a mop of black hair and bright green eyes checks a pot at the hearth. To Elias' right, a kind-faced woman with rolls of blonde hair shows a similarly-blonde young girl the intricacies of crafting jewellery. Bright and inquisitive, the young girl, who the lean man calls Lyra, explains that she has no interest in jewel-craft, and wishes for a life of adventure.

> *"I'm going to stalk the streets like Elias, rooting out injustice wherever it lurks!"*

Amara, a stern young woman of raven-black hair and startling eyes of verdant green curtly interjects - having previously been anxiously gazing out of the window. She reprimands Lyra for her naivety, and scolds her father for indulging it.

> *"We all have to grow up sooner or later, father."*

Their conversation is interrupted by an ominous knocking at the door, which grows ever more pressing and disturbing as the room and figures swirl before Elias, who wakes with a jolt.

At breakfast the next morning, the players decide to attend Whip's funeral, with the exception of Amotti - who is tasked with sourcing nautical transport for their planned journey across Lake Lenity. On their way to the Stables, Sel and Wild Bill share a quiet moment to discuss his true name and its lineage.

At the funeral, the players are greeted by a shaken [[Sam Clayborn]], and enter the stable-house to find Issy fussing over a spread of scones, bread with Lenity catfish roe, milk and whisky. Making their way to the paddock and the gathered crowd of mourners, they see [[Magnolia 'Old Mags' Aurix|Old Mags]] standing beside a freshly-dug grave and well-crafted wooden coffin. Also in attendance are Hattie Clayborn, Ignatius Barnett, [[Clarence Tryst]], the [[Arthur and Neall Carpenter|Carpenter brothers]] (Arthur and Neall) and the disgruntled man from the Town Meeting of the previous day with his family ([[Gram, Pernille and Clara]]).

Old Mags begins proceedings but, after a short introduction, admits that she is not best-fitted to deliver a eulogy for Whip and indicates to a previously-unseen figure in the crowd to step forward.

> *"Tom, would you like to say a few words?"*

The players turn to see a limping, crutch-assisted [[Thomias Blake]] being assisted to the front of the crowd by [[Jessie 'Doc' Lawrence|Jessie Lawrence]]. Despite his recovery still being clearly in progress, the ageing halfling still possesses the intelligent spark in his eyes and joie de vivre the players remember from their first meeting with him. In his eulogy, Thomias urges the townsfolk to use Whip's life of service as an example of how giving to your fellow neighbour and appreciating the humble beauty of the frontier can help make life worth living in this harsh new land. Arthur and Neall lower Whip's coffin into the grave, and the townsfolk pay their final respects before beginning to depart.

Thomias shuffles over to greet Ignatius warmly, and the two share a few words of grateful reunion. Wild Bill asks Old Mags about the possibility of purchasing a horse from the stables for Gambit, to which she agrees but asks him to discuss with her in the Town Hall later, the funeral not being the right place to discuss the selling of Whip's worldly possessions. Before he leaves, Mags asks that he and the party check in on [[Slim Ed]], who hasn't been seen at the funeral nor the previous day's meeting.

> *"Stubborn as an Owlbear that one, and half as smart, but I still worry about him with these things outside the walls."*

Determined to find some answers, Sel approaches Sam Clayborn, asking Caeldrid to distract Hattie while he does. Initially wary of the newcomer and cagey with his words, the heady cocktail of Sel's persistence, the fine whisky purchased from Hattie earlier, and the heightened emotions of the funeral eventually leads to Sam breaking down and confiding in the wizened tortle. He admits to Marie's passing, and to his keeping of knowledge of her death from Hattie. He explains that it started with a sickness, a wasting. After being told that nothing could be done for Marie by Jessie Lawrence, Marie insisted of Sam that he not reveal anything to Jeb and Hattie of her illness.

> *"She wanted to live her last days with their smiles still in her life."*

He elaborates on the details of his last night with Marie.

> *"On her last night, I took her out to the lake. She loved it out there. Just like when we were young, we took the blanket out and looked over the water. She stood up, kissed my hand, and walked out into the water. I can't explain it but the fog swirled round her and she just... faded. When it cleared she was gone. There's strange power in that lake, the Quagers know it more than us – I think it just called to her.*
> *She'd told me not to open the letter until she was gone, and so I didn't. But now it's all I can do... read it over and over. Servant help me, what have I done? My Jeb... Hattie... How can I make this right?"*

During their conversation, as Sam begins to sob, Hattie notices her father's distress from across the paddock and begins to leave Caeldrid. Panicking, Caeldrid grabs her hand and implores her to let Sel help her father. Hattie turns to Caeldrid with a look of vulnerability, yet trust, in her eyes and the two share a charged moment of connection.

The brief delay is all Sel needs to conclude his meeting with Sam. Visibly relieved to have gotten the story off of his chest, the Inn-keep stands and resolves to speak to his daughter that night and confess his concealing of Marie's passing. Before parting with Sel, he asks, as Hattie did of Wild Bill, that the party help to find the still missing Jeb.

The session ends as the players regroup and leave the stables, the threads of the Curse of Clement's Hollow beginning to weave together in their minds. Another day at the edge of the world awaits...
