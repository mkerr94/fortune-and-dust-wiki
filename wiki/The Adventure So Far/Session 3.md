# The Events of Session Three
The players begin Session Three in the dead of night, after bedding down in the [[Clayborn Inn]] of [[Clement's Hollow]].

[[Amotti]] wakes with a jolt, following a vivid nightmare in which he is consumed by countless small, black spiders. He wakes [[Gambit]] to discuss the potential religious implications of his dream, inadvertently alerting [[Elias Blackwood|Elias]] in the process. They all agree to return to sleep, however Elias' curiosity is piqued when he hears the back gate to the inn being closed. After heading outside to investigate under the pretence of grabbing *"a drink of fresh air"*, he spots a hooded and cloaked figure exiting the western gate of [[Clement's Hollow]] and decides to pursue. Observing Elias' strange movements from the window of their room, Amotti and Gambit (still as yet unsure of the motivations of their new companion) resolve to follow him into the night.

Meanwhile, [[Sel]] and [[Caeldrid]] also experience nightmares. In Sel's he is contentedly fishing on the shore of a vast sea before being consumed by a strange white light from further up the coast. In Caeldrid's, he fruitlessly tries to reach a burning village, before observing the image of a black dragon illuminated against a red sky. The two wake and, after a brief look out of the window of their room, decide to try and continue their rest.

[[Lythara Sunstrider|Lythara]]'s dream finds her flicking her bean in a palace made of black marble. She sees a female high elf atop a throne, throat pierced by a crossbow bolt. She feels a cold, steel dagger pressed against her neck and hears a distantly familiar voice in her ear before suddenly waking back in the honeymoon suite of the Clayborn Inn. Opening her room door, she sees Amotti and Gambit making their way downstairs and follows them as far as the door to Sel's room – where she is stopped after her footsteps alert him and Caeldrid to her presence. 

The commotion caused by this confrontation rouses [[Wild Bill]] from his similarly restless sleep, in which he dreams that he is blissfully drowning in a sea of salty, red liquid. Despite this, he, Sel, Caeldrid and Lythara all agree to stay in the inn – not wishing to seek further trouble on their first night in a new town.

Elias' pursuit of the cloaked figure leads him past the moonlit shores of [[Lake Lenity]] all the way to a clearing in [[Lenity Woods]], where he sees [[The Old Elm]] for the first time. He watches from the shadows as the figure investigates the base of the ancient tree, before being ambushed by three previously unseen creatures. Running back toward Elias, the figure is revealed to be [[Hattie Clayborn]], who quickly compels him to run from their assailants. Briefly looking back, Elias sees that they are being pursued by three grossly [[Mutant Lake-Lizards]], and frantically follows Hattie back to the western gate (bumping into a startled Gambit and Amotti on the way).

They make it back inside the walls of Clement's Hollow, lake-lizards close behind. Hattie sounds the town alarm bell, bringing the other players from the inn to the western gate. There, they are all confronted by a lake-lizard mutated with insectoid wings – while the other monsters continue to barge the gate itself. From behind the party, a bullet fired by [[Holden Smith]], arriving with [[Alvina]] after hearing the bell, strikes the mutated lake-lizard in the wing. Rifle barrel still smoking from the shot, Holden instructs Hattie to return to the inn for safety as he, a snarling Alvina and the players turn to face the oncoming threat.
